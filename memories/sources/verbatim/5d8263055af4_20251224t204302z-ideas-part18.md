        - ### Highlights
          - > fire in 1957 at Windscale, as the site was formerly known, was the UK’s worst nuclear accident to date. An EU report in 2001 warned an accident at Sellafield could be worse than [Chornobyl, the site of the 1986 disaster in Ukraine that exposed five million Europeans to radiation](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/oct/23/politics.afghanistan). Sellafield contains significantly more radioactive material than Chornobyl.
            - >
              - The report said events that could trigger an atmospheric release of radioactive waste at the plant included explosions and air crashes. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/revealed-sellafield-nuclear-site-has-leak-that-could-pose-risk-t-18c3aacee50#68615b5e-5c75-4dac-b965-37260ac15503)
          - > Sellafield is trying to extract decades of nuclear waste from MSSS, a facility dating back to the 1960s and described as “one of the highest-hazard nuclear facilities in the UK”, a task that it says could take at least 20 years. It has been leaking for more than three years.
            - >
              - A report in June from the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said while the current risk from the leak is deemed by Sellafield to be “as low as reasonably practicable”, scientists are increasingly concerned that the full scale of the leak, and the rate at which it may pollute the groundwater, is unclear. Sellafield is understood to argue that the leak poses “no additional risk” to staff and the public.
