- It's not true that some methods "use counterfactuals" and some don't. No method has access to counterfactuals. At best they use methods to *estimate* the counterfactual #key
      - In one sense, there are as many different kinds of causation as there are true explanations of how something works in some context. That many. In another sense, there is only one kind of causation.
      - It does make sense to try to list the number of ways we have to *learn about* causation ("epistemology not ontology")
- Social research & issues
  - in vivo vs free coding #kkkkk 
    - **In Vivo Coding** uses the **participant’s exact words** as the code label. You preserve their specific language, slang, or metaphors to prioritize their voice.
    - **Free Coding** (often used synonymously with *Open Coding* or *Descriptive Coding*) uses the **researcher’s words** to summarize, interpret, or label the data. You create a label that best describes what is happening, regardless of the specific words the participant used.
  - Social media
    - So this podcast, The Things Fell Apart, was with a professor called Walters, who says that civil wars start when #kkkk
      -  traditionally in power groups start to lose power, like the Serbs or white working class men.

    - Sea lion
      - This is the story of a day that I spent as an (unwitting) sea lion. 
      - The background is that, like a lot of people, especially in the UK recently, I've got more than fed up with Musk and everything he's up to, and also with the fact that on Twitter/X I seemed to be getting forever more sucked into reading fights about polarisation. So I thought I'd try BlueSky, which looks and feels very much like Twitter, but now seems to have enough people on it that you can actually find interesting things. And for me, equally important, it's an open model, a protocol which can be used by others, and you can move your data on and off the server, and you have more control over the algorithms that determine what you see.
      - I've been reading stuff on Twitter on and off for years, but I haven't been interacting so much. I like having conversations with people I only partly agree with, so my opinions can formulate and develop. I think that kind of discussion can be health for everyone. So I thought I'd try a bit of interaction on BlueSky. 
      - Then I saw a post from an artist, and they were criticizing a fairly generic image that had been created by AI, and they said it was horrible in so many ways. So I asked, "I'm interested, what in particular don't you like about it?" 
      - The guy came up with some interesting reasons why he didn't like the picture so much, or actually why he hated it. And I responded from my own point of view. (I'd share the picture but he has since blocked me so I can't.)
      - What I wasn't ready for was the wave of almost universally angry responses to what I put. I think the person I'd originally responded to was probably well connected in the creative arts community. And what I wasn't really ready for was the level of anger that people were feeling, which I hadn't really thought about, but now can completely understand, because it's an existential threat to creative people's jobs. 
      - I just couldn't persuade people that I was genuinely just trying to explore the issues and wasn't trying to shove my opinion down anyone's throat. I what was pretty immediately called the a*hole word on a couple of occasions and I people were sharing their outrage about my questions with one another and calling me, uh, various things, including a sea lion. I have to look that up. 
      - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning) "The sealioner feigns ignorance and politeness while making relentless demands for answers and evidence (while often ignoring or sidestepping any evidence the target has already presented), under the guise of "just trying to have a debate", so that when the target is eventually provoked into an angry response, the sealioner can act as the aggrieved party, and the target presented as closed-minded and unreasonable."
      - I think the implication is that it's a kind of troll, and they do that to wind people up. I've never been called a sea lion before. And my interest really wasn't it winding people up, but the more I said that, the worse it got. 
      - (I also found the Twitter-like tree structure of the conversations really hard to manage because many people made similar accusations at different parts of the threads, and my efforts to address each of them, they may maybe made it seem like I was just messing about on this point, I think Slack's very simple structure with main threads and just a single level of sub thread is maybe less logical to a computer person, but easier to navigate.)
      - I was accused of not acting in good faith by asking a question and then not responding enough to the answers. So I made a better attempt to consolidate my responses in one place, and then was accused of, again, not acting in good faith, but this time because, as I'd now been given all the actual answers, I shouldn't have anything really more to add. By this time, I'd already been blocked by a few members of what I guess was a creative arts bubble, which is quite different from the sort of bubbles I move in. 
      - I am sure there really are people who are a special kind of troll called a sea lion, who make a point of wasting their own and other people's time. 
      - But maybe if a group of people start calling someone else a sea lion, they should ask themselves how would know if the person was in fact genuinely trying to engage in a dialog, or maybe it's an issue that's maybe so important to them, that they can't really distinguish through the red mist. (I didn't say that, too scared.)
      - I I did feel they were, without exception, engaging in a kind of black or white thinking where specific aspects of AI were such a specific threat to their livelihoods or what's valuable to them that they didn't want to spend any energy on differentiating anything, so every single thing about AI was bad, and at the same time it was also not fit for purpose and useless,  and obviously always produces poor quality content, and is obviously always going to take everybody's jobs, and it is obviously a zero sum game in which only massive corporations win and everyone else uses, and it's a uniquely bad waste of electricity energy. (I didn't say that either.)
      - So my sea lion lesson for today is: the harder I tried not to be a sea lion, to simply respond to the content and make distinctions and comparisons, the more people thought I was.
      - (If I get a chance I'll make a separate post about what I learned from the discussion.)

  - Evaluation
    - OH / outcome harvesting
      - why do you super have to check OH outcomes #kkkk
        - they are primarily collected from implementers, not "beneficiaries" - that's why you super have to check them
      - what does heather say about scale in OH  #kkkk
        - it doesn't have to be that big cos you have to carefully delineate respondent and outcome sets
    - Bob Williams says (in response to welthungerhilfe looking for a new definition of impact, )  #kkk
      - words don't have definitions, only uses
    - Scriven
      - if eval is a ==transdiscipline #kkk==
        - it has something to offer others - scriven (Ghislain). if it is only a interdiscipline it has nothing unique, it is just applied
          - scriven the logic of valuing - five parts #kkk
            - the most original part is to say, sometimes the valuation is already implied in the ==definition ==of what we have to evaluate (or in the process of learning how to use the word), e.g. quality of figure skating, and that's how you get from observation to value, sometimes direct observation of value
            - so need to introduce
            - 1) ==context==
            - 2) allowing for ==vagueness==
            - 3) admitting ==direct observation of causation and value==
            - ? 4? ==probative reasoning==
              - which seems to have various subsorts and basically, I'm an evaluator, I can just see this
      - Scriven (1994, p. 378) highlighted that rejecting summation in evaluation means #kkk

      - hot and cold cultures #kkkkk 
        - 
        - Claude Lévi-Strauss's ideas on "hot" and "cold" societies were groundbreaking in anthropology and cultural studies. Here's a more detailed look at his concept:The Concept of "Hot" and "Cold" SocietiesLévi-Strauss introduced the terms "hot" and "cold" societies in the 1960s as a way to categorize different types of cultural approaches to history and change
        - .Cold Societies:
          - Seek to maintain equilibrium and continuity
          - Aim to minimize the impact of historical factors on their culture
          - View life as a cyclical process, constantly recreating the past
          - Attempt to preserve their traditional culture as unchanged as possible
        - Hot Societies:
          - Embrace change and historical factors
          - Internalize their history as a driver of development
          - Have a "greedy need for change"
          - View life as evolutionary rather than cyclical
        - Key Aspects of Lévi-Strauss's Theory
          - Universal Human Mind: Lévi-Strauss believed that despite cultural differences, the human brain functions similarly across all individuals, leading to common basic elements in all societies
          - Structuralism: He developed the approach of structuralism, which views cultural phenomena as interconnected parts within a system, each making sense in relation to the others
            - I think what we mean by structuralism is that the fact that I can suddenly have a pet and talk about it like a baby isn't just because I'm copying other people doing that specific thing it's because a whole system has shifted in that direction
          - Binary Opposition: Lévi-Strauss argued that the human mind tends to classify things through binary oppositions, contrasting two opposite concepts
          - Cultural Evolution: He saw the progression from "cold" to "hot" societies as an inevitable part of the civilization process
          - Rejection of Eurocentrism: Lévi-Strauss used this model to challenge Eurocentric ethnography and its distinction between "primitive" and "developed" societies

        - [Interpretive Anthropology](https://workflowy.com/#/dd5372bdb9b9) : Geertz introduced the concept of cultures as systems of symbols and meanings, profoundly influencing how anthropologists understand and interpret cultural practices. His work, particularly the study of the Balinese cockfight, demonstrated how deep ethnographic analysis could reveal the symbolic underpinnings of social actions and institutions.
