The future of the politician, who took power after President Jovenel Moïse’s 2021 assassination plunged Haiti into a spiraling security crisis now reaching a crescendo, looks bleak.

          - > At 9.21pm on Saturday, the police union tweeted another panicked appeal. It urged members of the security forces to race to the city’s main prison to help repel [a gang onslaught apparently designed to free thousands of dangerous inmates](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/04/haiti-mass-jailbreak-violence-port-au-prince-gangs). If the criminals escaped, “no one in the capital will be spared”, the union warned. “TOGETHER we can avoid the disaster.”
            - At around the same time, gunmen tried to overrun the international airport. “The gunfire was so intense, I thought they had reached my level in the building,” said one of the terrified police officers inside, who asked not to be named.
            - Airport security managed to beat back the assailants, but by daybreak on Sunday it became clear the national penitentiary had fallen. Nearly 4,000 inmates had fled, vanishing into the smoke and havoc consuming the second largest city in the Caribbean.

          - > Moody, who was still feeling fuzzy-headed, stayed in her flat – fretting with her friends, doom-scrolling on her phone and watching TV. On 26 March, not long after midnight, eight officers in stab vests showed up at her door. They took Moody in for questioning, but a duty solicitor – a publicly funded lawyer who advises people in custody – reassured her it would all blow over. When detectives interviewed her, Moody apologised for kicking the plastic shield. She had no idea that such an action could lead to a charge of riot, which could land her in prison for up to 10 years.

          - > The legal crackdown that followed has been stunning in its severity. Riot is the most serious public-order offence on the statute books, punishable with up to 10 years in prison, and requires senior approval within the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Such charges are extremely rare. In 2011, nearly 2,500 people were arrested in London after three nights of violence, looting and arson that followed the police shooting of [Mark Duggan](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2020/jun/10/mark-duggan-shooting-can-forensic-tech-cast-doubt-on-official-report). While many were charged with crimes such as theft and burglary, none was charged with riot. Nor was anyone convicted of rioting after the [anti-poll tax](https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/gallery/2015/mar/28/poll-tax-riots-revisited-in-pictures) disturbances in central London in 1990.

          - > To date, prosecutors have charged 38 people with riot for their involvement in the Bristol protests, including Fleur Moody. Nineteen have been convicted, with sentences ranging from three to six years. Nine protesters are now in prison, and arrests are still being made. More people, and more women, have been imprisoned for rioting during one day in Bristol than in any other protest-related disorder since at least the 1980s.

          - > At first, the anti-protest legislation attracted relatively little attention, save for warnings from human rights NGOs. But four days after the bill was introduced, when the Metropolitan police broke up a vigil in memory of Sarah Everard, who had been kidnapped and murdered by a serving police officer, public opposition to the bill exploded. News photographs showing police officers [pinning a young woman to the floor](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/mar/13/as-the-sun-set-they-came-in-solidarity-and-to-pay-tribute-to-sarah-everard) provoked widespread public fury. (Patel acknowledged that some of the scenes [were “upsetting”](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/priti-patel-sarah-everard-clapham-women-keir-starmer-b923976.html).)
            - In this moment, the “kill the bill” movement was born. Many of the women’s rights and BLM activists who had been involved in organising the Everard vigil on Clapham Common called for a new round of protests [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/it-was-so-wrong-why-were-so-many-people-imprisoned-over-one-prot-18e0d8276fe#172a4b76-32a7-488a-8d1f-b41f7e16e162)

          - > bill made criminal damage of less than £5,000 to a public memorial, such as a statue or monument, punishable with up to 10 years in prison, a sharp increase from the previous maximum of three months. The change was widely seen as a response to the toppling of the Colston statue.
            - Other Bristolians felt that their way of life, even their homes, were threatened by little-noticed parts of the bill. In Bristol, hundreds of people [live in vehicles](https://thebristolmayor.com/2021/08/25/bristols-vehicle-dwellers/) parked on streets, laybys and patches of undeveloped land – the local council estimates there are more of these so-called van-dwellers in the city than anywhere else in the country. Some choose to live a nomadic, low-impact lifestyle, while others are forced into vans by the city’s high rents. However, the bill made residing in a vehicle on land without permission from the owner a criminal offence, and gave the police the power to impound live-in vans. “For lots of people, their vehicle is the last barrier before homelessness,” says Toph Hind, who was 38 at the time and living in a van in Bristol. “And instead of addressing the issue, the government wanted to give the police powers to seize [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/it-was-so-wrong-why-were-so-many-people-imprisoned-over-one-prot-18e0d8276fe#edfd5b83-7d83-45de-aa15-3627c5afd38e)

          - > was given formidable resources: a team of 111 officers, who went on to review nearly 700 hours of footage from a variety of sources including CCTV, social media streams and TV camera crews. The police identified 44 alleged victims – all but one were police officers – and 158 suspects. “It was the biggest operation in Avon and Somerset’s history,” noted Riccio, who has been in the force for 25 years. “It was huge.”
            - On 23 March, Riccio’s team created their first online gallery of suspects and invited the public to help identify them. Pitman, Bond and Lazarus, who had never been in trouble with the police before, were shocked to see their faces in the gallery, which was all over the news. One by one they turned themselves in. At first, they were all charged with violent disorder, but this was later increased to riot, which [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/it-was-so-wrong-why-were-so-many-people-imprisoned-over-one-prot-18e0d8276fe#bc9ab2fb-3373-49f5-b6f9-26febca95c68)

          - > Pitman’s trial was first. Her family and friends had seen the evidence against her and were confident she would be cleared. The three-minute video played in court showed her talking to police, slapping a police shield with the palm of her hand, kicking out at police shields, and throwing a small object that she picked up from the ground. The prosecution argued Pitman, who is slightly built and 1.6m tall (5ft 3in), went to the front and challenged officers, which caused them to fear for their safety. To Pitman and her supporters, this did not seem like a compelling case.

          - > Moody was offered a plea bargain in May 2022. Frightened by the prospect of a long prison sentence, she took the deal, pleading guilty to affray. In November 2022, she was given a suspended sentence, sparing her from jail. “In my heart of hearts, it was so wrong,” Moody told me. “But I saw Charly $$Pitman$$ get sent down for nothing. The police were lying and painting such a horrible picture of us … so I took it.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/it-was-so-wrong-why-were-so-many-people-imprisoned-over-one-prot-18e0d8276fe#6187a1e0-6c0a-4dd5-91bf-bd389584c1f7)
