        - **[(C. Zhang et al., 2023)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?CFyZ9s) show that LLMs such as GPT 4.0 can easily identify causal connections in text using domain knowledge. We can expect GPT 4.0 to identify more or causal connections which are more or less explicitly stated within a text, but to fail where causal reasoning is necessary.(but see[(L. Zhang et al., 2023)](https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?4PqeeT) for some interesting ways to augment causal reasoning)**
