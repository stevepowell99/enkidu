- **Purpose**
  - Show how QuIP-style causal mapping can compare an official programme ToC (“their theory”) with empirically coded beneficiary narratives (“our theory”), as a disciplined way to revise ToCs and “middle-level theory”.

- **Minimal definition (what a causal map is)**
  - A causal map is nodes + directed links, where a link means (at minimum) *someone believes C influenced E*.
  - Links need not encode necessity/sufficiency, nor quantified strength/polarity (though those are sometimes added in other approaches).

- **QuIP as causal mapping**
  - Goal-free / (partially) blindfolded elicitation of stories of change reduces confirmation bias.
  - “Causal back-chaining” elicits causes, causes-of-causes, etc.
  - Coding is inductive and multi-source; maps are then filtered/queried to answer evaluation questions.

- **How analysis is actually done**
  - Global maps are too large; use filters (e.g. theme/keyword searches, distance steps, frequency thresholds).
  - **Hierarchical coding / zooming out**: encode subfactors in factor labels so detailed factors can be rolled up into higher-level factors for readable summary maps.
  - Evidence strength is often shown with counts on links (mentions / sources).

- **Interpretation pitfalls (explicitly listed)**
  - **Beliefs about causation are not facts about causation**: evaluator judgement remains separate.
  - **Absence of a mentioned link is not evidence of absence** (random-walk conversations; negative cases).
  - **Transitivity trap / context overlap**: stitching A→B (source 1) and B→C (source 2) does not justify A→C unless contexts overlap.
  - Aggregation/generalisation is non-trivial; counts support confidence but don’t convert to “truth percentages”.
