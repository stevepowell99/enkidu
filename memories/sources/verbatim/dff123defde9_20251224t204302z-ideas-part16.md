- > what the two dominant narratives miss most of all is what happened between the 1950s and the late 80s – namely the story of how British produce improved to reach the level those writers craved and those restaurants needed: how British farmhouse traditions were revived, how wholefoods and the organic movement shifted consumers’ diets and shopping habits, how the world-class produce being made by a tiny number of rural farmers found an audience in affluent city-dwellers. This revolution has many strands, but to explain it fully you have to look to another small cadre of upper-middle class members of the late-60s counterculture.

      - > And at the centre of this scene was Nicholas Saunders. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/hippy-capitalist-guru-grocer-the-forgotten-genius-who-changed-br-18d35947088#8a18f30c-0fa6-4f46-a0e2-ee8749cfae7e)  ^8a18f30c

        -  Christiania reminded Saunders of the energy of 60s London. It was, he felt, truly changing how people lived. There was a “real luxury of life there,” Saunders wrote in 1976\. “Fresh wholemeal rolls with butter and strong freshly ground coffee for breakfast is normal. All the food is best quality – the organic vegetables straight from farming communes. I never saw anyone drink instant coffee.” [⤴️]([https://omnivore.app/me/hippy-capitalist-guru-grocer-the-forgotten-genius-who-changed-br-18d35947088#f43904e1-e16c-4f43-bab7-88ead658a23f](https://omnivore.app/me/hippy-capitalist-guru-grocer-the-forgotten-genius-who-changed-br-18d35947088#f43904e1-e16c-4f43-bab7-88ead658a23f))  ^f43904e1
      - > Wholefoods sold in bulk were favoured by people living in communes, who could stock up on essentials cheaply. But if you didn’t live in a commune, you could only buy wholefoods at expensive health food shops run by hippies who, in Saunders’ words, “would make customers feel bad because they could not recognise a mung bean”. Saunders hated these shops, which he saw as inefficient, expensive and exclusionary. If wholefoods were going to reach as many people as possible, he needed to offer something different.

It was decked out in the cheapest, utilitarian way possible, “Christiania style” as [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/hippy-capitalist-guru-grocer-the-forgotten-genius-who-changed-br-18d35947088#a40c24e4-1a5e-4b24-a452-59ffcca03488)  ^a40c24e4
      - > If he had franchised the Neal’s Yard ethos, Saunders could have become another Richard Branson, a former hippy who had so carefully studied the vices of capitalism that he had learned how to become one of its most skilful exponents. What made him different was his habit of giving away his most successful businesses.

      - > By the mid-90s, the influence of the Dairy had grown to the point that any cheese it sold was globally significant solely by virtue of being stocked there. [Cheese](https://www.theguardian.com/food/cheese) shops in the US could show they were serious by buying cheddar from Neal’s Yard. The best British restaurants could prove they cared enough about native produce by removing the French cheese course that had traditionally punctuated meals and replacing it with cheeses from the Dairy. Trevor Gulliver, who opened the era-defining restaurant St John with Fergus Henderson in 1994, told me that “there was no one else”, when it came to [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/hippy-capitalist-guru-grocer-the-forgotten-genius-who-changed-br-18d35947088#d5dd55d9-7f3c-4cc5-bed3-be0af81215ef)  ^d5dd55d9
      - > During these years, what the dairy was doing for cheese, Monmouth was doing for coffee. [James Hoffmann](https://www.jameshoffmann.co.uk/), one of the architects of Britain’s third-wave coffee movement, remembers coming to London in the early 2000s and being struck by how out of step Monmouth was with everything else going on. “At that time, coffee in England was a joke globally,” Hoffmann recalls. Monmouth was the only place in London doing good filter coffee, even if they didn’t advertise it. It was also transparent about where its coffee was from, a continuation of Saunders’ seventh rule. “They proved a model that people will pay more for better coffee that tastes of somewhere [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/hippy-capitalist-guru-grocer-the-forgotten-genius-who-changed-br-18d35947088#0d9724ef-b012-464f-961b-41ce2703b125)  ^0d9724ef
      - > The new incarnation of Borough Market opened in 1998\. Though it was only the second regular farmers market in the UK – [the first was in Bath](https://visitbath.co.uk/shopping/markets) – it was an immediate success, feeding a new culture that deemed it desirable, even fashionable, to eat well. The columns of Nigel Slater and the TV shows of Jamie Oliver broadcast to the world that the best produce in the UK, maybe even Europe, could be found at Borough.

      - > By 2005, the reputation of British food had transformed so much that American food magazine Gourmet dedicated an entire issue to London, calling it “the world’s best place to eat”. In her introduction to the issue, editor Ruth Reichl named four places in the first paragraph: St John, Neal’s Yard Dairy, Monmouth Coffee and Borough Market.

      - > way. His commitment to understanding MDMA would find him turning up to drum’n’bass raves, nervously looming over a baffled crowd of people a third of his age, who eventually adopted him as their own. “I experienced a feeling of belonging to the group, a kind of uplifting religious experience of unity that I have only felt once before, when I was part of a community \[Christiania\] that was threatened with closure,” he later wrote. Saunders combined all his research, including a thorough scientific analysis of every single street pill he came across, into a book published in 1993 called E For Ecstasy. Saunders’ website [[ecstasy.org](http://ecstasy.org/)]([http://ecstasy.org/](http://ecstasy.org/)) would become as canonical to the 90s counterculture as Alternative London had been for the 70s; his acolytes called him the new Timothy Leary.

            - > The Guardian has released its selection of the best youngsters at Premier League clubs since 2014, and I decided to continue counting months of birth: 2021 was also 13-7; then, counting back to 2014, it was 15-5, 14-6, 14-6, 14-6, 15-5, 16-4 and 18-2.
              - >
                - Fascinating. The Next Generation 2022 scholars were not an outlier. For the 180 players across nine seasons, 136 (more than 75%) were born in the first semester and 44 in the second. By quarter of birth, September to November had 74, December to February 62, March to May 28, and June to August 16\. There are almost five times more players from the first quarter than the last, and similar skewed amounts by month of birth: September, 29; October, 29; November, 16; December, 21; January, 25; February, 16, March, 14; April, 10; May, four; June, five; July, five; and August, six.

                - What does this mean? Obviously that if you want a child who will be on this list you had better make arrangements so he is born as soon as possible after 1 September.

          - > Perhaps it has something to do with the way scouts and coaches are assessed. Usually, youth coaches want to win the under‑10, under‑12 or under‑14 local championship and get promoted to older age groups.
