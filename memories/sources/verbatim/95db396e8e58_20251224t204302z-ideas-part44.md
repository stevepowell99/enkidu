- when you pay ‘rent’ for a home in the UK, 30 per cent of that money, on average,#kkk
      - provides you with the shelter you need. The rest is the charge you pay to use the space it occupies.
    - One of the fundamental ‘reforms’ pursued by neoliberalism was to privatize these public services (or at least as many as capitalism’s servants in government could get away with), transferring collective resources into exclusive ownership. We can still use them, #kkk
      - but now, on top of the payment that the state or the customer makes for the actual service provided (water, or sanitation, or transport, or hospitals, or housing), we have to pay – either individually or as taxpayers – an extra fee to those whose exclusive property the service has become. This fee is what we mean by rent.
    - We end up with what the economist John Kenneth Galbraith described as #kkkk
      - ‘private opulence and public squalor’:
    - Take ‘investment’. Business, government and the media use this word to mean two entirely different things.#kkk
      - One is the use of money to create productive and socially useful assets or services that did not previously exist; the other is to capture and milk assets already in existence. A private-equity company might ‘invest’ in housing, without paying for a single brick to be laid upon another. What the word means in this context is buying existing buildings in order to charge rent or to benefit from their rising price. By confusing enterprise with rent, the word ‘investment’ disguises this extractive activity.
    - Now the situation has been flipped on its head: those who make their money from rent seek to pass themselves off as entrepreneurs. People like #kkk
      - Donald Trump,
    - There were two principal reasons for what seemed, at the time, to be unstoppable growth. The first is a familiar one: the rise of social democracy. #kkk
      - The destruction of the wealth and power of the elite, caused largely by two tectonic events – the Depression and the Second World War – created an opening for the redistributive policies of John Maynard Keynes, among others. A more equal distribution of wealth, accompanied by increased state spending and a strong social safety net, enhanced the spending power and economic security of those who had previously lived in poverty, boosting their demand for goods and services. This generated growth that further boosted demand in a cycle which seemed, during the ‘glory years’ of 1945 to 1975, to be self-sustaining.
    - The steady rise of prosperity across the Global North during this period was, to a large extent, financed by the Global South. We look back on the era when Keynesian economics dominated as a time of peace and prosperity, and many in the wealthier nations experienced it as such. But it was also a time in which #kkk
      - decolonization was resisted with extreme violence and oppression by the colonial nations,
    - The coup in Chile was the experiment upon which #kkkk
      - Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan both drew when they came to power, respectively in 1979 and 1981. Pinochet’s economic programme was devised and overseen #kkkk
        - by neoliberal economists from the University of Chicago, and enthusiastically supported by Milton Friedman,2 Friedrich Hayek and the neoliberal international.
    - In other words, during the ‘glory years’, economic life within the rich nations was fairer than it had ever been before – or has ever been since. But relations between rich and poor nations during the Keynesian era remained grossly unjust and coercive. Neoliberalism’s contribution was to ensure that economic life became grossly unjust and coercive everywhere
    - neoliberalism treats growth as an end in itself, entirely divorced from utility, like the ruthless production targets of Mao Zedong in Communist
    - For while neoliberal capitalism continues to loot the South to enrich the North, it also #kkkk
      - loots the future to enrich the present.
    - Neoliberalism is a political neutron bomb. #kkk
      - The outward structures of politics – such as elections and parliaments – remain standing, but following the irradiation of market forces, little political power remains to inhabit the space behind the facades.
    - Because voters demand restraints on economic power – whether that involves restricting corporate concentration, the antisocial behaviour of businesses and the very rich, extreme inequality or environmental destruction – democracy is the problem that capital is always striving to solve. Neoliberalism is the means of solving
    - ‘strongmen’ – who claim to be advocates for the aggrieved and disenfranchised, armed with the promise of a return to traditional values – appeal to those who have been failed by the system.
    - suggests that around xx per cent of the world’s population now lives under ‘some form’ of authoritarian rule.#kkkk
      - 72
    - Children who experience emotional neglect, according to some findings,17 suffer worse mental-health consequences than children suffering from both emotional neglect and physical abuse: horrible as it is, violence at least involves attention and contact.
    - Their spending is an example of what is now commonly referred to as ‘dark money’ #kkkk
      - cash whose purpose is to influence political outcomes, but whose sources are not fully disclosed (if at all). This dark money is neoliberalism’s fuel. It has propelled its policies into politics, the media, academia and wider public life.
    - The Koch brothers have founded or significantly funded over #kk
      - ==thirty ==lobbying groups. They include Americans for Prosperity, the Manhattan Institute, the Cato Institute,
      - Take The Heritage Foundation, into which they have poured over $6 million.12 In January 1981, conveniently timed for Ronald Reagan’s inauguration, The Heritage Foundation published a work called Mandate for Leadership.13 The document extended to 3,000 pages, across twenty volumes. It contained 2,000 policy proposals #kkk
        - an astonishing 60 per cent of those 2,000 proposals had been implemented.
    - not restricted themselves to influencing Republican politicians. Bill Clinton’s ‘Third Way’ policies were to a large extent formulated by #kkk
      - a lobby group called the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC).21,22 Sitting on its Executive Council were past, present or future representatives of some of the biggest and most ruthless corporations in the United States, including Enron, Chevron, Texaco, DuPont, Microsoft, IBM, Philip Morris, Verizon Communications, Merck, American Airlines and, of course, Koch Industries.23 Two senior Koch executives were members of its board of trustees.24 The committee shaped what Clinton and Al Gore called ‘a new approach to government’ that ‘offers more empowerment and less entitlement
    - But perhaps the most disastrous legacy was Clinton’s repeal in 1999, at the urging of neoliberal lobbyists, of the Glass-Steagall Act – legislation introduced in the New Deal era under Franklin Roosevelt in response to the 1929 stock market crash and Great Depression. The act had separated #kkk
      - commercial and financial banks.
    - Trump’s team was largely composed of personnel from #kkk
      - think tanks funded by the ==Koch brothers, Exxon, the Donor’s Trust (widely seen as the ‘dark-money ATM’ of the political right),== and other powerful economic interests.30 In other words, the lobby groups funded by oligarchs and corporations were no longer influencing the government. They were the government. Trump’s extraordinary plan to cut federal spending by
    - the Atlantic a corresponding network developed, in some cases funded by the same donors. It began in London in the 1950s, with two fanatical disciples of Friedrich Hayek: Antony Fisher and Oliver Smedley. In 1955 they founded the first of Europe’s neoliberal think tanks, #kkk
      - the ==Institute of Economic Affairs==. One of the IEA’s two founding co-presidents, Arthur Seldon, was vice-president of Friedrich Hayek’s Mont Pelerin Society.1 The IEA was also one of the publishers of Hayek’s The Road to Serfdom.
    - But a note sent from Smedley to Fisher shows how, from the outset, its true purpose was to remain veiled.2 #kkk
      - It was, as Smedley urged, ‘imperative that we should give no indication in our literature that we are working to educate the Public along certain lines as having a political bias. That is why the first draft [of our aims] is written in rather cagey terms.’ The IEA’s foundation was ‘cagey’ in more than one sense. Its initial funding came from the fortune that Anthony Fisher had made by importing ‘broiler chicken farming’ (a cruel and
    - reprehensible. As political scientist Susan George noted,4 ‘In 1945 or 1950, if you had seriously proposed any of the ideas and policies in today’s standard neoliberal toolkit, you would have been laughed off the stage or sent off to the insane asylum.’ But Fisher was undeterred, and would go on to help found institutes similar to the IEA in other countries,
    - By 2017, the Atlas Network, which Fisher had founded in 1981, was supporting nearly #kkkkk
      - 500 neoliberal think tanks in over ninety countries.
    - Astonishingly, the IEA is still registered as #kkk
      - an ‘educational charity’, and lists its official purpose as helping ‘the general public/mankind’.7 As a result, it is tax exempt.
    - Every Saturday in the late 1970s, in a London wine bar called the Cork and Bottle, researchers working for Margaret Thatcher – then Leader of the Opposition – convened with leader writers from The Times and the Daily Telegraph, and staff from the ==Adam Smith Institute and the Institute of Economic Affairs==. Over lunch, they ‘planned strategy for the week ahead’.
    - Pirie describes how his group devised and polished many of the most important policies implemented by Margaret Thatcher and her successor, John Major. He has claimed (with plenty of supporting evidence) credit for 
      - the privatization of the railways, 
      - and several other public services; 
      - the poll tax (a classic neoliberal flat tax, under which everyone, rich or poor, pays the same amount – its unpopularity forced Thatcher’s resignation); for 
      - the sale of public housing to private buyers; 
      - the creation of internal markets in education and health; 
      - the establishment of private prisons; and, years later, 
      - the Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, for the slashing of taxes paid by the rich.
    - Pirie also asserts that he wrote the manifesto for the ultra-neoliberal wing of Mrs Thatcher’s government, #kkkk
      - ==No Turning Back.== Officially, the authors of the document – which was published by the party – were Conservative Members of Parliament such as Michael Forsyth, Peter Lilley and Michael Portillo.10 ‘Nowhere was there any mention of, or connection to, myself or the Adam Smith Institute. They paid me my £1,000 and we were all happy.’ Pirie’s report became the central charter of what we now call ‘Thatcherism’, whose Praetorian Guard would brand themselves the ‘No Turning Back’ group.
    - few people would view a tobacco company as a credible source of opinion on public health, or a coal company as a neutral commentator on global heating and climate breakdown. So they pay others to pose as neutral commentators and speak on their behalf – this secrecy is essential to the success of the model. The veteran corporate lobbyist Jeff Judson wrote an essay titled ‘21 Reasons Why Free-Market Think Tanks Are More Effective than Anyone Else in Changing Public Policy (and one reason why they are not)’,
    - We call it the ‘==Pollution Paradox’==. #kkkk
