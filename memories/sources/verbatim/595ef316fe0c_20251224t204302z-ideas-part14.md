It was like: ‘Aren’t we different?’; and I was like: ‘You’re not really *that* different.’ I was irritated by the performative nature of it all, you know: all soft and squishy, but hard as nails on the inside.

          - > The title of a book caught my eye: *The Nature of Economies* by Jane Jacobs. I did not know her, but I was intrigued by the title. I opened it and read the jacket copy. The book was written as a Platonic dialogue between three friends, which intrigued me even more. I bought the book and finished reading it before landing in Bangkok on my way back to Phnom Penh two days later.
            - As I read the book, I experienced a profound realisation. Through the words of Jane Jacobs and the characters in the book, I discovered a language for systems thinking.

          - > Jane Jacobs was a renowned and self-taught urbanist, writer, and activist who lived from 1916 to 2006. Her most famous book, *The Death and Life of Great American Cities* (1961), profoundly impacted the way we think about city planning and city systems. She opposed the centralised, expert-driven urban renewal planning that characterised much of mid-20th century urban design in the United States.

          - >			* Economies are complex adaptive systems, not static machines. They continuously and dynamically evolve similarly to biological organisms.
          - Like ecosystems, economies grow through processes of diversification, specialisation, and creating new niches.
          - Healthy economies naturally shift from relying on imports to producing goods and services themselves. This process drives innovation and expansion.
          - Natural systems use feedback loops (both positive and negative) to maintain stability. Jacobs believes similar processes exist within economies.

          - `across()`, `relocate()`,`rename()`, `select()`, and `pull()`use **tidy selection** so you can easily choose variables based on their position, name, or type (e.g. `starts_with("x")` or`is.numeric`).

            - Data masking and tidy selection make interactive data exploration fast and fluid, but they add some new challenges when you attempt to use them indirectly such as in a for loop or a function. This vignette shows you how to overcome those challenges. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/programming-with-dplyr-dplyr-18deea23357#b007a4db-6468-484d-b1f7-3a5673f9eb43)
