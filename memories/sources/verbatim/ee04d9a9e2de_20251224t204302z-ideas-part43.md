- That’s more or less where we find ourselves today. The dominant ideology of our times – that affects nearly every aspect of our lives – for most of us has no name. If you mention it, people are likely either to tune out, or to respond with a bewildered shrug: ‘What do you mean? What’s that?’ Even those who have heard the word struggle to define it. Its anonymity is both a symptom and a cause of its power. It has caused or contributed to most of the crises that now confront us: rising inequality; rampant child poverty; epidemic diseases of despair;
    - What is neoliberalism? It’s an ideology whose central belief is that competition is the defining feature of humankind. It tells us we are greedy and selfish, but that greed and selfishness light the path to social improvement, generating the wealth that will eventually enrich us all. It casts us as consumers rather than citizens. It seeks to persuade us that our well-being is best realized not through political choice, but through economic choice – specifically, buying and selling. It promises us that by buying and selling we can discover a natural, meritocratic hierarchy of winners and losers. ‘The
    - The blame for systemic failure #kkk
      - is individuated. We absorb this philosophy until we become our own persecutors. Perhaps it’s no coincidence that we’ve seen a rising epidemic3 of self-harm and other forms of distress, of loneliness, alienation and mental illness. We are all neoliberals now.
    - unpacking: Capitalism is an economic system founded on #kkk
      - colonial looting. It operates on a constantly shifting and self-consuming frontier, on which both state and powerful private interests use their laws, backed by the threat of violence, ==to turn shared resources into exclusive property, and to transform natural wealth, labour and money into commodities that can be accumulated==.
    - first capitalism #kkk
      - Onto the blank slate of Madeira’s land, the colonists imported labour in the form of slaves, first from the Canary Islands 300 miles to the south and then from Africa. To finance their endeavours, colonists imported money from Genoa and Flanders. Each of these components – #kkk
        - land, labour and money – had been stripped of their social meanings before. #kkk
          - But arguably not all in the same place, at the same time. By the 1470s, this tiny island became the world’s biggest source of sugar.
    - amazing speed at which that productivity #kkk
      - peaked and then collapsed. Sugar production on the island peaked in 1506, just a few decades after it began. Then it fell precipitously, by 80 per cent within twenty years – a remarkable rate of collapse. 
      - They left. They took their operation to another recently discovered island further south, São Tomé, 190 miles off the west coast of central Africa. There the pattern that had been established on Madeira was repeated: Boom, Bust, Quit. #kkk
        - When sugar production in São Tomé went bust, the Portuguese moved on again – this time to #kkk
          - the coastal lands of Brazil, where their much bigger operations followed the same script: Boom, Bust, Quit. Then other imperial powers moved to the Caribbean, with the same results, burning through one frontier after another.
    - escape hatches for the super-wealthy to be exploited once Earth is no longer habitable.
    - The fairy tale of capitalism grew wings in 1689, when #kkk
      - John Locke published his Second Treatise of Civil Government.11 Locke claimed that ‘in the beginning all the world was America’. By this, he meant a terra nullius: like Madeira, a no man’s land in which wealth was just waiting to be taken. But, unlike Madeira, the Americas were heavily inhabited – #kkk
        - by tens of millions of indigenous people. To create his terra nullius they would have to be erased – either eradicated or enslaved.12 But this was just the beginning of Locke’s myth-making. He went on to claim that the right to own land, and all the wealth that sprang from it, was established through hard work. ==When a man has ‘mixed his Labour’ with the land, Locke asserted, ==he ‘thereby makes it his Property’.
    - The fairy tale that capitalism tells about itself – #kkk
      - that you become rich through hard work and enterprise – is the greatest propaganda coup in human history.
    - The term ‘neoliberal’ was coined #kkk
      - at a conference in Paris, in 1938.1 Among the delegates were two of the people who came to define the ideology: Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Both #kkk
        - exiles from Nazi-occupied Austria, they saw the New Deal that Franklin Roosevelt had introduced in the United States, and Britain’s burgeoning welfare state, as expressions of collectivism.
    - In 1947, Hayek formed the first organization to promote neoliberalism, #kkk
      - the Mont Pelerin Society (MPS).8 There, he and others began to create what has been described as a ‘==Neoliberal International==’9 – a transatlantic network of academics, journalists and businesspeople seeking to develop a new way of seeing and running the world.
    - The rich backers hired policy analysts, economists, academics, legal experts and public-relations specialists to create a series of ‘think tanks’ that would refine and promote the doctrine. These institutions, many of which still operate today, tended to disguise their purposes with grand and respectable names, such as #kkkk
      - the ==Cato Institute, ==
      - ==The Heritage Foundation, ==
      - ==American Enterprise Institute, ==
      - ==the Institute of Economic Affairs, ==
      - ==the Centre for Policy Studies and the ==
      - ==Adam Smith Institute.== 
      - While they presented themselves as independent bodies offering dispassionate opinions on public affairs, in reality they behaved more like corporate lobbyists, working on behalf of their funders.
    - As it evolved, neoliberalism became more strident. For example, Hayek initially opposed monopoly power. But in 1960 he published another best-selling book, #kkk
      - The Constitution of Liberty,21 in which he radically changed some of his arguments.
    - He began the book by advancing the narrowest possible conception of liberty: #kkk
      - an absence of coercion. Hayek rejected the primacy of such notions as democratic freedom and equality, universal human rights, or the fair distribution of wealth, all of which, by restricting the behaviour of the rich and powerful, intruded on the absolute freedom from coercion – that is, the freedom to do whatever you want – that neoliberalism demanded. Democracy, by contrast, he claimed, ‘is not an
    - Hayek justified this position by creating a heroic narrative of extreme wealth. #kkk
      - He conflated the economic elite – spending their money in new and creative ways – with philosophical and scientific pioneers. J==ust as the political philosopher should be free to think the unthinkable, so the very rich should be free to do the undoable, ==without constraint from public interest or public opinion. The ultra-rich are ‘scouts’, ‘experimenting with new styles of living’, who blaze the trails that the rest of society will follow. The progress of society, Hayek held, depends on the liberty of these ‘independents’ to gain as much money as they want, and to spend it as they wish. All that is good and useful therefore arises from #kkk
        - inequality.
    - It may come as no surprise to those who follow such matters that in 1974 Hayek was awarded #kkk
      - the Nobel Economics Prize.
    - Despite the success of Hayek’s books, the neoliberal programme of empowering the rich and letting the devil take the hindmost was met with widespread public revulsion. It wasn’t until the 1970s, as the post-war economic boom finally came to an end and Keynesian economics began to run into various crises, that neoliberalism was able to occupy the resultant ideological vacuum. The success of Keynes’s model relied to a large extent on #kkk
      - capital controls, fixed exchange rates, and strongly regulated financial markets, which both prevented speculators from sucking money out of national economies and ensured that government stimulus measures (cutting interest rates or increasing spending on public services) catalyzed manufacturing and jobs at home, rather than in other countries with competing industries. When, in 1971, Richard Nixon #kkk
        - abandoned the system of fixed exchange rates, he opened the door for speculation and capital flight.
    - In 1975, a few months after Margaret Thatcher became leader of the Conservative Party, one of her colleagues (or so the legend goes) was explaining what he saw as the core beliefs of conservatism. #kkk
      - She snapped open her handbag, pulled out a dog-eared book, and slammed it on the table.34 ‘This is what we believe!’ she said. The book was The Constitution of Liberty.
    - Milton Friedman’s masterstroke was implanting the idea that #kkk
      - ‘business freedom is personal freedom’ in the minds of Americans.
    - The Democratic and Labour Party leaders who followed in Reagan and Thatcher’s wake did not possess a meaningful alternative to the neoliberal narrative. Rather than developing a new political story, Bill Clinton and Tony Blair thought it was sufficient to triangulate. In other words, they extracted a few elements of the Keynesianism their parties had once advocated, mixed them with aspects of their opponents’ neoliberalism, and developed from this unlikely combination #kkk
      - a ‘Third Way’.
    - to Clinton’s repeal of the 1933 #kkkk
      - Glass-Steagall Act (that had been pushed through Congress by FDR’s administration to regulate the financial sector in the wake of the Great Depression).
    - But neoliberalism developed in a different era, by which point most adults had the vote. It recognized that, in the face of widespread resistance, the state would have to intervene to impose its desired political outcomes on an unwilling population, to liberate ‘the market’ from democracy.
    - As the 1970s progressed, neoliberal ideas and policies came increasingly to shape the agendas of international financial institutions, #kkk
      - including the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which imposed neoliberal economics on indebted nations in Africa, Latin America and Asia.9 In return for debt relief or loans, ‘Structural Adjustment Programs’ were demanded, which included privatization, deregulation, trade liberalization, the abandonment of capital controls, and ‘fiscal austerity’, which meant slashing state spending on health, education and other public services. These decisions were imposed without people being given
    - It is highly misleading to describe neoliberalism as ‘free-market economics’. In many ways it’s quite the opposite. Neoliberalism is the tool used by the very #kk
      - rich to accumulate more wealth and power. Neoliberalism is class war.
      - the offshore arbitration system known as #kkkk
        - Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS)
          - allows those ‘aggrieved’ corporations to sue the nation. If the nation loses, their democratic decisions are overturned. So much for national sovereignty. Corporations often emerge with more sovereign power than states.
    - Since 1989, America’s super-rich have grown about #kkk
      - $20 trillion richer.3 The poorest 50 per cent, by contrast, have become 1 trillion poorer.4
    - What is rent? The term has several meanings that are readily confused, so let’s take a moment to clarify. In this context, rent means #kkk
      - unearned income. It’s the ‘private tax’ that the owners of property or services can charge, above and beyond any investment they’ve made, to the people who wish to use them. Remember that capitalism, under our definition, ‘turns shared resources into exclusive property’.
