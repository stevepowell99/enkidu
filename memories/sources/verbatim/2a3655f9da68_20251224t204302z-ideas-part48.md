        - almost the entire conversation was taken up by “the gender question”. Shriver complained that the left was “obsessed” with it, as she proceeded to take every question back to it. In an hour and a half of conversation, neither Shriver nor Sayers brought up economic inequality and poverty once.

          - 16 months: longer than anyone has served for peaceful protest since all adults had the vote.
You might have thought that was enough – many times more than enough – for peaceful civil disobedience. But no. Marcus is a German citizen with pre-settled status in the UK, where he lives with his family: his partner, Holly Cullen-Davies, and his two stepchildren. Any non-citizen who has been sentenced to at least 12 months in prison is, unless they successfully appeal, automatically deported to their country of origin. According to the immigration charity Settled, this appears to be “the first time in the UK that the power of deportation has been used after a criminal conviction flowing from a protest.”"

          - The portcullis excluding us from power has never been properly lifted since the Norman conquest. The relationship between rulers and ruled remains, in effect, a relationship between occupier and occupied.

              - **Eadric *the Wild*** (or **Eadric *Silvaticus***), also known as **Wild Edric**,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadric_the_Wild#cite_note-1) **Eadric *Cild*** (or ***Child***[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadric_the_Wild#cite_note-2)) and **Edric *the Forester***,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadric_the_Wild#cite_note-3) was an Anglo-Saxon magnate of [Shropshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shropshire) and [Herefordshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herefordshire) who led English resistance to the [Norman Conquest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Conquest), active in 1068–70
              - Eadric was one of a group of people well known in their own day as 'silvatici'. [Orderic Vitalis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orderic_Vitalis) says in his description of the English risings of c.1068-9 that many of the rebels lived in tents, distaining to sleep in houses lest they should become soft, so that certain of them were called *silvatici* by the Normans. ... he is not the only [chronicler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronicler) to make it clear that the English resistance was very widespread or to describe the rebels as taking to the woods and marshes. The [Abingdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abingdon,_Oxfordshire) chronicle says that many plots were hatched by the English and that some hid in woods and some in islands, plundering and attacking those who came in their way, while others called in the [Danes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danes_(Germanic_tribe)), and that men of different ranks took part in these attempts ... That they should have made their bases in wild country and, like the twentieth-century *[maquis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maquis_(World_War_II))*, have been named for it, is perfectly credible.

            - > Stamped “Secret and Personal”, the document was a memo by Robert (later Lord) Armstrong, the then cabinet secretary, sent to Thatcher in February 1985. I discovered the report while working on a Channel 4 series about the miners’ strikes, which threatened the British state as nothing had since the second world war. I always suspected MI5 had played a more interventionist role, but coming across this document was a revelation.
              - how did mi5 interfere in miners strike  #kkk
                - 
                - Armstrong detailed a series of secret meetings in Whitehall with an unnamed MI5 officer. Their conversation did not concern foreign spies, subversion, national security or official secrets. The agenda was how to find the funds and assets of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). A lawsuit – orchestrated by David Hart, the machiavellian political adviser to Thatcher – had succeeded in declaring the dispute illegal because a national ballot had not taken place. When the NUM refused to call off the strike, the high court found the union guilty of contempt of court and issued a £200,000 fine. And when the NUM refused to pay up, a judge ordered its funds to be seized by the court-appointed sequestrator.
                - In anticipation of the court order, the NUM had transferred the union’s £8.7m through seven countries before it ended up in banks in Dublin, Zurich and Luxembourg. It was a covert and deliberately convoluted operation involving NUM officials taking private flights from Jersey to obscure banks in Luxembourg.
                - At first, the complex scheme to hide the miners’ cash was successful. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/for-years-i-suspected-mi-5-interfered-in-the-miners-strike-the-t-18e197d6d1e#3ac56989-7eaa-413d-9064-f18a039b545d)

            - > How did Larkins find the secret accounts? After the strike, he was asked about his source. “It is a difficult area,” he replied.
              - The answer is contained in Armstrong’s secret memo to 10 Downing Street: MI5 leaked confidential details of NUM bank accounts and the movements of union officials to Price Waterhouse, seemingly based on covert surveillance and phone tapping.
