1. **Create Projects**: Create a project and upload PDF or docx documents into it as source material for analysis (we call each document a "source"). You can have multiple projects, and each project usually contains multiple sources.
   - See [Projects Panel](../projects-panel/) and [Upload Documents](../upload-documents/).
2. **Create Causal Links manually**: Identify and highlight causal claims within the source text; each highlight becomes a new causal link. After you have created multiple links you can view them as a causal map.
   - Use the [Create Links tab](../create-link-tab/) and view results in the [Map panel](../map-panel/).
3. **Create Causal Links using AI**
   - See [AI Coding](../ai-coding/).
4. **Filter & Analyze**: Apply filters to your causal links focus on specific aspects of your data
   - Use the [Analysis Filters](../filter-link-tab/): Do qualitative causal analyseis on the selected links by filtering manipulate those links.
   - Explore [Map](../map-panel/), [Factors](../factors-panel/), [Links](../links-panel/), and [Statistics](../pivot-panel/).
6. **Collaborate**: Work together live with multiple users
   - Manage sharing in [Sharing and Permissions](../sharing-and-permissions/).
