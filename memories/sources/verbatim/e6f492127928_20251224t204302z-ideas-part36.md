- (c. 1600 – c. 1155 BC), three and a half K years ago, based on much older source material. In the epic, 
      - His rule probably would have taken place sometime in the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period, c. 2900 – 2350 B"
    - Gilgamesh  #kkk
      - is a demigod of superhuman strength who befriends the wild man Enkidu. Together, they embark on many journeys, 
    - most famously defeating  #kkk
      - Humbaba (Sumerian: Huwawa) and the Bull of Heaven, who is sent to attack them by Ishtar (Sumerian: Inanna) after Gilgamesh rejects her offer for him to become her consort. 
    - After Enkidu dies of a disease sent as punishment from the gods,  #kkk
      - Gilgamesh becomes afraid of his death and visits the sage Utnapishtim, the survivor of the Great Flood, hoping to find immortality. Gilgamesh repeatedly fails the trials set before him and returns home to Uruk, realizing that immortality is beyond his reach. Most scholars agree that the Epic of Gilgamesh exerted substantial influence on the Iliad and the Odyssey, "
- Physics/ maths
  - medoids and centroids serve as central points representing a cluster of data. However, they are fundamentally different in how they are determined and their relationship to the dataset. The core distinction is that #kkk
    -  a **medoid must be an actual data point** within the cluster, whereas a **centroid is the calculated average position of all data points** in the cluster and may not correspond to any real data point
  - P=NP #kkkkk 
    - Are all problems verifiable in polynomial time actually solvable in polynomial time?
    - Problems in NP: In computer science, a similar concept exists in complexity theory. The class of problems known as NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) consists of problems for which a proposed solution can be verified as correct efficiently (in polynomial time), even though there is no known efficient algorithm to find the solution in the first place. The famous "P vs NP" problem asks whether these two classes of problems are actually the same. This provides a computational analogy to the "hard to solve, easy to check" nature of insight problems.
  - "satellite communication system using geostationary orbits.[8] He was the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1946 to 1947 and again in 1951–1953.[9]
    - Clarke emigrated to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1956, to pursue his interest in scuba diving.[10] That year, he discovered the underwater ruins of the ancient original Koneswaram Temple in Trincomalee. Clarke augmented his popularity in the 1980s, as the host of television shows such as Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World. He lived in Sri Lanka until his death.[11]
    - Clarke was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1989 "for services to British cultural interests in Sri Lanka".[12] He was knighted in 1998[13][14] and was awarded Sri Lanka's highest civil honour, Sri Lankabhimanya, in 2005.[15]

  - Landauer's principle #kkk
    - asserts that there is a minimum possible amount of energy required to erase one bit of information, known as the Landauer limit
    - fundamental connection between information and the physical world
    - implications for data centres, Moores Law, shows why quantum computers are better
  - words sin tangents and cosine #k
    - are Arabic. [a different way is possible](https://workflowy.com/#/743bd5e22d8c) 
  - simple pythagoras proof? from "equations which changed the world"
    - There is a very nice proof of Pythagoras's theorem if you draw a square inside a square with its corners touching the sides you can then look at the four triangles created and pick one of them the its longest side pot and uses the side of the square and then if you draw another square and rearrange those other triangles you can show that the's area of the smaller squares must equal the area of the larger square.
  - kolmogorov complexity #kkkk [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexityAuthor:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexityAuthor:) Steve Powell
    - In [algorithmic information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_information_theory) (a subfield of [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics)), the Kolmogorov complexity(also known as descriptive complexity, Kolmogorov–[Chaitin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Chaitin) complexity, algorithmic entropy, or program-size complexity) of an object, such as a piece of text, is a measure of the [computational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation) resources needed to specify the object. xfact
  - big bang was not the beginning #kkk
    - there was no infinitely hot point. there was a before, which was cold but full of energy in the fabric of spacetime
    - the hot Big Bang definitely happened, but doesn’t extend to go all the way back to an arbitrarily hot and dense state. Instead, the very early Universe underwent a period of time where all of the energy that would go into the matter and radiation present today was instead bound up in the fabric of space itself. That period, known as cosmic inflation, came to an end and gave rise to the hot Big Bang, but never created an arbitrarily hot, dense state, nor did it create a singularity. What happened prior to inflation — or whether inflation was eternal to the past — is still an open question, but one thing is for certain: the Big Bang is not the beginning of the Universe!
    - that traditional model is perhaps a misunderstanding of Hawking
  - what is a closed form solution  #kkkk
    - A closed-form solution, in mathematics and related disciplines, refers to a solution to a problem, equation, or model that can be expressed analytically in a finite number of standard operations and functions.
      - In contrast, problems that cannot be solved analytically are often approached through  #kkkk
        - numerical methods, which provide approximate solutions by iterative computation. These numerical solutions can be highly accurate and practical for many applications, especially when closed-form solutions are unavailable or too complex to be useful. However, they do not offer the same straightforward, formulaic relationship between inputs and outputs that a closed-form solution does.
  - entropy vs enthalpy  
    - enthalpy is a measure of the total energy of the system
    - entropy is a measure of its disorder
    - so when gas is compressed into one part of a chamber, then the separator is opened,  #kkkk
      - enthalpy stays the same but entropy increases

    - ==horizontal gene transfer ==- known since 70s but not in publick imagination ...
    - helped initiate are ==three counterintuitive insights==, three challenges to categorical thinking about aspects of life on earth. The categoricals are these #kkk
      - ==species==, ==individual==, ==tree==. Species: It’s a collective entity but a discrete one, like a club with a fixed membership list. The lines between this species and that one don’t blur. Individual: An organism is also discrete, with a unitary identity. There’s a brown dog named Rufus; there’s an elephant with extraordinary tusks; there’s a human known as Charles Robert Darwin. No mixing refutes the oneness of an individual. Tree: Inheritance flows always vertically from ancestor to descendant, always branching and diverging, never converging. So the history of life is shaped like a tree
    - identified the third basic lifeform, #kkk
      - ==archaea  (live in extreme conditions) ==and ==bacteria==, although both prokaryotic (no true nucleus), are as distinct from each other as they are from ==eukaryotes==
      - highlighted the importance of molecular biology in classifying organisms and has provided insights into the evolutionary history of life on Earth

  - "High fantasy #kk
    - has often been defined by its themes and messages.[13] "Good versus evil" is a common one in high fantasy, and defining the character of evil is often an important theme in a work of high fantasy,[14] such as The Lord of the Rings. The importance of the concept of good and evil can be regarded as the distinguishing mark between high fantasy and sword and sorce"

  - Childe Roland #kkk
    - The story tells of how the four children of the Queen (by some accounts [Guinevere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinevere)), [Childe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childe) Rowland, his two older brothers, and his sister, Burd Ellen, were playing ball near a church. Rowland kicked the ball over the church and ==Burd Ellen went to retrieve it, inadvertently circling the church "[widdershins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widdershins)", o==r opposite the way of the sun, and disappeared. ==Rowland went to [Merlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(wizard)) to ask what became of his sister== and was told that she was taken to the Dark Tower by the King of [Elfland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfland), and only the boldest knight in [Christendom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christendom) could retrieve her.
    - The eldest brother decided he would make the journey, and was told what to do by Merlin. He did not return, and the middle brother followed, only to meet the same fate. Finally Childe Rowland went forth, having been given his father's sword, which never struck in vain, for protection. Merlin gave him his orders: he must chop off the head of anyone in [Elfland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elfland) who speaks to him until he sees his sister, and he must not eat or drink anything while in that realm. Rowland obeyed the orders, dispatching a horseherd, a cowherd, and a [henwife](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/henwife), who would not tell him where his sister was. The henwife would only say he had to circle a hill three times widdershins, and say each time "Open, door! open, door! And let me come in." Following the instructions, a door opened in the hill and Rowland entered a great hall, where sat Burd Ellen, under the spell of the King of Elfland. She told him he should not have entered Elfland, for misfortune befell all who did, including their brothers, who were prisoners in the Dark Tower, nearly dead.
    - Rowland, forgetting Merlin's words, was overcome with hunger and asked his sister for food. Unable to warn him, she complied. At the last moment, Merlin's words returned to Rowland and he threw down the food, upon which the King of Elfland burst into the hall. Rowland fought with the King, and with the aid of his father's sword beat him into submission. The King begged for mercy, and Rowland granted it, provided his siblings were released. They returned home together, and Burd Ellen never circled the church widdershins again.
