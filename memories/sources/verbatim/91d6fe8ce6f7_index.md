# 💐Causal Mapping: a Garden of Ideas





🌸 Starting to use the Causal Map app and want to know more about the theory and practice of causal mapping? What is it, what is it good for, how can you do it?

🌻 You've skimmed through a couple of our publications but want to see how it all fits together?

🪻 Here you'll find dozens of one-pagers setting out the key ideas in causal mapping as we see it, curated and assembled from existing publications and blog posts. 

The titles of most of these "ideas" pages are expressed in the form of a single thought or claim or idea, like "Causal coding is easy to automate". 

This Garden will also serve as a background companion to the [Causal Map app](https://causalmap.app). The app has its help which is also integrated into the app itself. Those help pages are also available as the [last chapter of this Garden](#app). That chapter is all about how to use the app whereas the rest of this Garden is a more discursive look at the theory and everything that surrounds causal mapping.

We have also included some of our most popular LinkedIn posts, especially on AI. 














> ⚒️ This site is very much a work in progress! A lot more ideas are still to come!
