- Sudanese Nuer. Ever since the Oxford social anthropologist E. E. Evans-Pritchard published his classic ethnography of them in the 1940s, the Nuer were held out as the very paradigm for ‘egalitarian’ societies in Africa. They had nothing even remotely resembling institutions of government and were notorious for the high value they placed on personal independence. But by the 1960s, feminist anthropologists like Kathleen Gough were showing that, again, you couldn’t really speak of equality of status here: — location: [2941]([kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WCL3V7Q&location=2941](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08WCL3V7Q&location=2941)) ^ref-29706

      - and, despite being so unsteady that she had to be carried into the building on a stretcher, managed to give a rousing speech lasting more than 40 minutes. “The fight of the labouring masses,” she declared, is “the fight for their full liberation.” She wasn’t a fan of feminism (dismissing it as bourgeois), but it was Zetkin’s dream that women everywhere, especially the most deprived and marginalised, might one day be free of all forms of oppression. The Nazis took power in Germany shortly after. Zetkin fled to Russia and died there.
        - On the day I went to see Zetkin’s former home north of Berlin in Brandenburg, now a museum, there were no other visitors. Despite her iconic status in her own time, she has been largely lost to history. Her bravery is remembered usually as a footnote to the fact that [she helped found]([https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2012/mar/08/clara-zetkin-international-womens-day](https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2012/mar/08/clara-zetkin-international-womens-day)) what we now know as International Women’s Day.

- astronomy
  - what is the proof that the universe is expanding #kk
    - "nd eternal static universe. In the hypothetical case that the universe is static, homogeneous at a large scale, and populated by an infinite number of stars, any line of sight from Earth must end at the surface of a star and hence the night sky should be completely illuminated and very bright. This contradicts the observed darkness and non-uniformity of the night sky.[1]
      - The darkness of the night sky is one piece of evidence for a dynamic universe, such as the Big Bang model. That model explains the observed non-uniformity of brightness by invoking expansion of the universe, which increases the wavelength of visible light originating from the Big Bang to microwave scale via a process known as redshift. The resulting microwave radiation background has wavelengths much longer (millimeters instead of nanometers), which appear dark to the naked eye and bright for a radio receiver.
      - Other explanations for the paradox have been offered, but none have wide acceptance in cosmology. Although he was not the first to describe it, the paradox is popularly named after the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers (1758–1840"

    -  the International Evaluation Academy is doing a three horizons [Three Horizons](https://workflowy.com/#/c328e70a4e58) exercise to try to look at what evaluators and actually non evaluators, what they perceive as you know, the future steer for evaluation, giving the transformational agenda and the poly crisis and all of that. 
    - "Three Horizons" [Three Horizons](https://workflowy.com/#/c328e70a4e58) ... connects the present with desired (or espoused) futures, and helps to identify the divergent futures which may emerge as a result of conflict between the embedded present and these imagined futures1. 3H maps overlapping waves of change visible in the present as mindsets: managerial, visionary, and entrepreneurial."

- Language
  - It's quite false to say that European languages evolved from a common ancestor because  #kkk
    - let's say 3000 years ago the languages spoken across the Indo-European area were, for all anyone in computational linguistics knows, just as heterogeneous as they are now. 
    - you see the tree graphic of all these modern languages and how they are successive branchings from an original trunk. It's obviously false in the idea of diversity coming out of simplicity. Whereas almost the same graphic can be produced synchronously, i.e. only out of present day data, by doing a hierarchical cluster analysis of the features of the language.  
    - There wasn't one language then any more than there is one language now.

    - Fun fact: In 1943, scientists searched the world for a source of penicillin and discovered the highest yielding strain of penicillium on a moldy cantaloupe in a Peoria Illinois fruit market.

  - Alex Ferguson  
    - Ferguson had a spat in 2003 with previous shareholders about a racehorse and and ended up getting very unsettled because of the scene as being inferior to Wenger when they had a season when they were unbeaten and focus on was starting to lose it, #kk

      - Cathy was Catholic but Alex started playing for rangers
      - He took a lot of stick and went downhill, bought two pubs
      - That was 1986
    - Alex Ferguson was assistant Scotland manager when they were playing wales at Cardiff and had to get a draw and equalized at the end and then #kkk
      - Jock stein the manager died of a heart attack and that was something that made Ferguson think that he might want to stop early which he nearly did in 2000 and Fergie was then the Aberdeen manager and took over at that point for 1-2 games
  - Fullbacks #kkk
    - Fullbacks are positioned on the flanks of the defensive line, outside the center backs. In formations with a back four, there is typically a right and a left fullback
    - In a 3-5-2 formation, the positions are:
    -  * 3 Center-Backs * 5 Midfielders, broken down into:   * 2 Wingbacks (one on the right, one on the left)   * 3 Central Midfielders * 2 Forwards (or Strikers)
  - what was sung before ‘Abide with Me’ sung at the FA Cup final? #kkk
    - Alongside weddings, funerals, coronations and and military ceremonies, ‘Abide with Me’ can also be heard at football fields and rugby stadiums.
    - The hymn has been sung at every FA Cup Final since 1927, when it replaced ‘Alexander’s Ragtime Band’, and prior to the kick-off at every Rugby League Challenge Cup Final since 1929."
      - 
      - Wikipedia reminds us that it isn't actually a ragtime song, but was part of a wave of ragtime mania which swept the world. Prince Felix Yusupov, an affluent Russian aristocrat who married the niece of Tsar Nicholas II and later murdered Grigori Rasputin, was described as dancing "around the ballroom like a demented worm" and shouting, "More ragtime!"
