              - “But at higher levels of development, delinking growth from environmental impact isn’t just possible in principle but something that happens a lot in practice.”

          - > Doughnut [Economics](https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics) Action Lab. Now adopted by towns and cities across Europe, doughnut economics involves calculating the impact of all policies on the social and physical environment. Aspects of life from income to housing and energy are displayed as sections on a doughnut shape, with its inner and outer edges representing a social minimum and an ecological ceiling. Finding a balance between the two is vital to ensuring wellbeing for both people and the planet.

              - Britain is a laggard on doughnut policies compared with many European countries, but Grcheva says a growing number of local authorities are using a dashboard – or in Cornwall council’s case, a doughnut-like decision wheel – to judge the impact of what they [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/are-young-people-poised-to-slam-the-brake-on-endless-economic-gr-18c2bd66f39#5bd40d04-86a0-4a82-adc9-ed699598cb86)

          - > Valuing costs and benefits in the same units is a strength because it means we can reconcile them and summarise the results of the analysis in a [single number](https://juliankingnz.substack.com/i/107305738/for-example). (Of course, the number isn’t an evaluative judgement - it’s just a number, but it can contribute evidence toward a sound judgement).

One would be treated with bloodletting – the other would go without. “We shall see how many funerals both of us will have,” wrote van Helmont.

        - According to the “Book of Daniel”, in 597bc Daniel, a Jewish servant in the Babylonian court of King Nebuchadnezzar, refused to abandon his vegetarian diet. One of the king’s advisers, Ashpenaz, worried that ==vegetarianism== would enervate Daniel, making him less able to serve. Daniel proposed that they put Ashpenaz’s theory to the test. He and three others were fed a vegetarian diet for ten days while the others ate meat. When Ashpenaz compared the two groups at the end of the ten days, the vegetarians were healthier, stronger and sharper (and soon became the king’s favourites)."
