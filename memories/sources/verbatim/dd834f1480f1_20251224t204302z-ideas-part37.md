- In the version given by [F. A. Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._A._Steel) in her *English Fairy Tales*, originally published in 1918 (republished by Macmillan in 2016), when Rowland finds Burd Helen, or at least an enchanted version of her, and she speaks to him, he remembers Merlin's instructions and cuts her head off, which brings back the real Burd Helen. This explains why the first two brothers had not returned; they could not bring themselves to cut off her head, and had become enchanted themselves.

    - By I didn't really interesting conversation with the chatbots as first of all chomsky's ideas of generative grammar being something that's actually it's most interesting for close to a tautology or some kind of very hard to disprove foundational theory because it basically just says wasn't wonderful thing that language can have infinite meaning from a finite set of building blocks and obviously our brain to finite and obviously we can reduce an arbitrary large set of feelings that

      - the concept of [Gestalt ](https://workflowy.com/#/68ebcb91a499)is not popular in modern psychology because we are hypnotised by this idea of brains as big data computing machines. But Gestalt asks: what is it about the moment of realisation, when the parts come together to form a simple whole? or when we see things as a duck, not as as rabbit?

      - the number of suicides through a series of national initiatives and interventions.
      - By contrast, in 2022 Finland had 740 suicides, in a population of 5.6 million – more in line with (though slightly higher than) the EU average. ButAdd notes to this highlight...national suicide prevention project, which ran between 1986 and 1996, and lowered suicide mortality by 13%. Partonen puts down the success of this programme to improved care for depressive disorder, quicker and earlier detection, and the advent of better treatments. Also introduced were best-practice guidelines on how to treat other psychiatric disorders, including alcohol abuse and personality disorders. While these had a positive impact, Partonen says many sufferers still do not receive any help because they do not seek it or their treatment gets discontinued.Add notes to this highlight...

    - James Clear, the author of "Atomic Habits." #kkk
      - 1. The Power of Tiny Gains
        - Clear emphasizes that small habits, when compounded over time, can lead to significant improvements. He illustrates this with the concept of getting 1% better each day, which can result in being 37 times better after one year.
      - 2. Focus on Systems, Not Goals
        - Clear argues that while goals are important for setting a direction, systems are crucial for making progress. He suggests that focusing on the process rather than the outcome leads to more sustainable success.
      - 3. Identity-Based Habits
        - One of the central ideas in "Atomic Habits" is to focus on who you want to become rather than what you want to achieve. By aligning habits with your desired identity, you create a more profound and lasting change.
      - 4. The Four Laws of Behavior Change
        - Clear introduces a framework called the Four Laws of Behavior Change, which provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones:
        - Make it ==Obvious==: Increase the visibility of cues that prompt your desired habits.
        - Make it ==Attractive==: Make the habit appealing by associating it with positive experiences.
        - Make it ==Easy==: Simplify the action required to start the habit.
        - Make it ==Satisfying==: Provide immediate rewards to reinforce the habit.
      - 5. The Habit Loop
        - Clear breaks down the process of habit formation into four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. Understanding this loop helps in designing effective habits and eliminating bad ones.
      - 6. Habit Stacking
        - This technique involves linking a new habit to an existing one, making it easier to remember and perform. For example, if you want to start meditating, you could do it right after brushing your teeth in the morning.
      - 7. Environment Design
        - Clear emphasizes the importance of shaping your environment to support your habits. By making good habits easier to perform and bad habits harder, you can significantly influence your behavior.
      - 8. Continuous Improvement
        - The book stresses the importance of regular review and adjustment of your habits. This ongoing process ensures that your habits evolve and improve over time, leading to continuous personal growth.

    - The biggest EVER review of behaviour change efforts has dropped (and it's not good news) 👇🏻
    - Academics at the University of Pennsylvania recently published a HUGE review on what changes behaviour. ¹
    - To my knowledge, it's the most comprehensive (and latest) review out there.
    - It studied the impact of both...
    - ↳ Person-focused efforts (e.g., attitudes, habits).
    - ↳ Environment-focused efforts (e.g., norms, processes).
    - The 3 key lessons?
    - 1️⃣ 𝘔𝘰𝘵𝘪𝘷𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯, 𝘴𝘬𝘪𝘭𝘭𝘴, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘬𝘯𝘰𝘸𝘭𝘦𝘥𝘨𝘦 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘰𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘥.
    - Most behaviour change methods in business aim to:
    - ↳ Give people new knowledge or skills, and...
    - ↳ Motivate them to change their behaviour.
    - But this review showed this strategy has a "negligible" impact on behaviour.
    - This isn't good news. It shows that current efforts will likely waste huge amounts of time, money, and effort.
    - We must focus LESS on changing:
    - ↳ Skills
    - ↳ Beliefs
    - ↳ Emotions
    - ↳ Knowledge
    - So, what should we do instead?
    - 2️⃣ 𝘞𝘦 𝘮𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘵𝘢𝘳𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝘩𝘢𝘣𝘪𝘵𝘴.
    - The most impactful person-focused intervention?
    - → Habit change efforts.
    - Which help people to shift their automated routines.
    - And yet, the science of habit change is barely applied in businesses.
    - This presents a HUGE opportunity. One we must take if we wish to create longer lasting behaviour change in businesses.
    - Habit change becomes easier if we also act on the final lesson...

    - ↳ Social support

          -  “divergent and convergent thinking” in the 1956 theory of human intelligence called the Structure of Intellect Model (SI). Brainstorming is an example of divergent thinking, where many ideas are generated in response to an open-ended task or question. In contrast, the output of convergent thinking is a single correct answer to a well-defined problem."

    - to be able to provide a causal explanation of events. 
  - Humans, although flawed, are still the best causation detectors we have #key
    - Counterfactuals
    - Most agree that counterfactuals are somehow part of the definition of causation #key
      - It is endlessly hard to agree exactly how counterfactuality fits into causation, because he died of a heart attack just before he was shot, so he would have died anyway #key
