- **Purpose**
  - Position QuIP + causal mapping as a credible, cost-effective way to elicit and analyse perceived drivers/barriers in complex interventions (including health services evaluations).

- **Data collection stance**
  - QuIP focuses on *changes* that matter to respondents, and the perceived causes of those changes.
  - Goal-free / blindfolded questioning is used to reduce pro-project bias; unprompted mention is treated as important evidence.
  - Not designed to estimate effect sizes; complements (rather than replaces) quantitative inference and other theory-based approaches.

- **Coding stance (“natively causal”)**
  - Coding is not thematic tags that are linked later; coding is **pairs/chains of cause→effect factors** (“causal nuggets”).
  - Coding is parsimonious: only causal claims are coded; non-causal descriptive text is not.
  - Inductive label harmonisation across sources is expected; analyst should manage positionality and avoid over-fitting to prior ToC.

- **Use**
  - Compare empirical causal maps against ToCs; compare groups (e.g. men/women; staff cadres) and pathways.
  - Keep a traceable link from visual summaries back to underlying quotes for verification/peer review.

- **Relationship to realist ideas**
  - Affinity to mechanism/context thinking (multiple pathways), but with broader open capture rather than only a few “hotspots”.
