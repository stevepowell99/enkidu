- **Purpose**
  - Pilot an AI interviewer (“Harvest Assistant”) for Outcome Harvesting (OH) in the KLAR! programme, focusing on scalability, inclusion, and democratic evaluation value.

- **Key method move**
  - AI-led interviewing + AI post-hoc transcript analysis to draft a structured OH outcome table.
  - Strong emphasis on **traceability**: verbatim short citations + page references; explicit missing-information prompts.
  - Human validation checks accuracy and de-duplicates overlapping outcomes across sources (triangulation).

- **Results highlights (as reported)**
  - 39 invited; 19 responded; 38 outcome statements; 6 met SMART criteria; others retained as leads.
  - Real-time outcome summaries enable respondent validation and transparency.

- **Operational insights**
  - Prompt simplicity improves adherence; model choice matters; version prompts/models for comparability.
  - Scaling shifts bottlenecks to analysis unless the end-to-end workflow is designed.

- **Risks / responsible scaling**
  - GDPR/legal basis, consent, third-party naming pathways; document data flow and model/prompt versions; data sovereignty (EU-hosted inference where possible); attention to equity/digital divides.
