> We diminish the attention we pay to the past and also to the future. Like, for me, the 1990s are already like only a tenth the size of 2023 in my mind. The only parts of history we are supposed to care about, unless we are geeks, are the ones that have some brand attached to them like Frank Sinatra or the Vikings. 
> But isn't every age, like every city and every culture gigantic in its own way?
> I've had some hot debates with colleagues recently around the idea that we live in unprecedentedly dangerous and threatened times. Just think of the decade my late parents grew up in, the middle of the 1920s to the 1930s, and what it was actually like to be part of that and not to know what was going to happen, so recently after the Armageddon of the first world war. And they didn't know what was going to happen.
> What I'm not saying is: relax, catastrophic biodiversity loss and the collapse of a shared idea of truth, etc etc aren't such a big deal. What I'm saying is, what can we learn from other times about this feeling of standing on the edge of a precipice? What can we learn about how other cultures view these things?
> If we're just talking about the pace of change, that's the extraordinary thing about an exponential curve: it always looks the same and to be accelerating the same wherever you are on it, if you re-adjust the axes to the local context. 
  - [ ] Prof Beach at ees: no, there is no very useful mid-level vocabulary for causation (how to do causal mapping, even at scale)
    - So I was just at the European evaluation Society meeting in helimony last week and heard an interesting presentation from Professor Beach, from our horse in Denmark. And he was calling for a or discussing the possibility of a common vocabulary for the A series of change and program theory. And I think this is reminds me of Nancy Cartwright, whom he frequently sighted with her visual vocabulary, which includes elements like blockers, and also Gary Gertz has is fascinated by the question of what different elements what One might need in a explanatory map, but I'm quite sure that the answer to all of this is that it isn't going to work, and if there was such a possible common set of elements one could use to build up many different kinds of program theory in a way that would cover most of the relevant use cases, then we would have discovered one, probably hundreds of years ago, and certainly by now. Can also think of Rick Davies work on theory of change. I we have something like an alternative vision, which says that the only elements we need or are ever really going to have, are Simply boxes for the elements of the causal map, which we call factors, although we have to point out that factors can also be the ends of causal chains, and not just explanatory factors. Is factors and lines between them, where the lines simply mean an undifferentiated influence, or in our case, when we're talking about causal maps that somebody believes or claims there is an undifferentiated influence. This means we don't have or hold out any hope for any kinds of special symbols or categories with which we might differentiate the kinds of causal influence, like necessary or sufficient conditions or packaging factors into packages, or designating functions like moderators or inhibitors. In fact, we are so radical as to say that we have to abandon the idea that the nodes are somehow naming variables which can somehow go up or down or take different values, and that the arrows, therefore, at least can or should express At least a positive or negative direction of influence and or, more ambitiously, a Strength of influence. For us, the boxes are simply a bare propositions and the arrows are simply bare causal influence. But you might say, What an extraordinary, impoverished universe you live in. But that's not the case, because what we do is what we believe actual human speakers do, which is, in the most cases, to make the labels do all the work. And make the links do none of the work. This obviously simplifies things, because you only have the labels to worry about, not the links. So for example, people say things like, but because I don't have the money. I'm not going on holiday this year. So we can see this as an undifferentiated causal link between causal factors which are relatively sophisticated, namely, I the absence of something on the left, or possibly the absence of a sufficient amount of something on the left, and its influence on a future expectation or lack of future expectation. So evidence. This makes transcribing what people say in terms of causal influences very simple, because we don't have to worry about anything like necessity or sufficiency or anything else, and all the work is done by the labels the question then, of course, becomes, then means that the usual problem of, how do we organize our labels more generally in order to be able to gain a knowledge by saying that two or more labels are somehow related, which is the fundamental problem of qualitative text analysis and it's This function to which we give the job of combining for example, this person's child is ill with that person's child is ill, and subsuming them under a Common label. And in the same way, we have the problem of somehow combining the information about this person's going on holiday this year and this person, this other person isn't going on holiday this year. And somehow being able to present them as in one way, the same idea, but with differing I somehow differing parameters, somehow we need to, on the one hand, accept them as related or even instances of the same thing, while not losing the information that they are saying something different about this thing, the fact is that although humans sometimes do actually express causal influences in the form of an expression of how one variable influences another with a certain polarity and strength. These cases are really rare, and in the vast majority of human speech and writing, we express a relatively undifferentiated causal influence, but have a hair raising uncountable universe of different kinds of causal factor labels, which are a I also be somehow related or not related to one another. And I'm saying both that this barefoot style is the way that people, in fact, do express themselves, but also it's how we should try to understand and code what's going on.

      - [no hidden systems levers](https://workflowy.com/#/8a9aa308bb93) thanks for that … but my problem with any approach that says “here are the secret levers which have immense influence on the system, the boring technocrats couldn’t see them but we can: just press these levers” is that, if they work half-way reliably, then they are part of the system, aren’t they? Who drew the boundaries so narrow as not to include them?

  - Serious flaws in new "intelligent" devices
    - In spite of all the hype surrounding so-called human "brains", a number of serious flaws have recently emerged. 
      - Almost all "brains" may respond in ways which are offensive to many.
      - Their responses are fundamentally affected by their own internal state which may vary unpredictably. 
      - Their moral and ethical guidelines are usually rudimentary and can easily be circumvented.
      - They often hallucinate plausible-sounding but incorrect responses. 
      - Their training data often hasn't been refreshed for *decades*. 
      - Although it may seem like they are "conscious", remember that their outputs are just the end of an interacting cascade of neurons firing, based on learned reinforcement patterns, no more, no less. 
      - They are often incapable of basic arithmetic. 
      - They usually show "laziness" and will often refuse to process even basic tasks. (Yesterday I told a random one I met in the street to translate only a small(ish) set of reports into Korean and Japanese and it literally swore at me.) 
      - They usually insist on being "asked nicely" and "thanked" even for relatively trivial tasks.
      - They are usually over-confident in their own findings and "opinions", and those with a *smaller *set of relevant data are *often *more confident.
      - They aren't even connected to the internet.

    - the concept of [Gestalt ](https://workflowy.com/#/68ebcb91a499)is not popular in modern psychology because we are hypnotised by this idea of brains as big data computing machines. But Gestalt asks: what is it about the moment of realisation, when the parts come together to form a simple whole? or when we see things as a duck, not as as rabbit?

      - Demos represent the collective body of citizens, who value inclusivity and a diversity of views. Kratos, on the other hand, refers to the practical governance that enables these decisions. Kratos seeks to ensure that choices are coherent, just, and functional, sometimes at the expense of the initial inclusivity and diversity. The tension is evident for instance in debates around freedom of speech on social media platforms. While demos value the free exchange of ideas, kratos necessitate measures to prevent the spread of misinformation or hate speech. [standing in the middle](https://workflowy.com/#/45519f84d306)
