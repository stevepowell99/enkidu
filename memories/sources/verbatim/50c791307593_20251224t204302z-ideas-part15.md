- The main challenge of programming with functions that use data masking arises when you introduce some indirection, i.e. when you want to get the data-variable from an env-variable instead of directly typing the data-variable’s name. There are two main cases:
            - >			* When you have the data-variable in a function argument (i.e. an env-variable that holds a promise2), you need to **embrace** the argument by surrounding it in doubled braces, like`filter(df, {{ var }})`. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/programming-with-dplyr-dplyr-18deea23357#d665cd26-b3dc-4496-88e8-e7f5b74bc5e2)
        - -
          - > When you have an env-variable that is a character vector, you need to index into the `.data` pronoun with `[[`, like `summarise(df, mean = mean(.data[[var]]))`. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/programming-with-dplyr-dplyr-18deea23357#1ab857e3-f411-4d8f-b680-7ee55e893974)
        - -
          - > Note that `.data` is not a data frame; it’s a special construct, a pronoun, that allows you to access the current variables either directly, with `.data$x` or indirectly with`.data[[var]]`. Don’t expect other functions to work with it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/programming-with-dplyr-dplyr-18deea23357#4b221b89-20a0-42ce-98aa-9c9983deda6b)
        - -
          - > Many data masking functions also use dynamic dots, which gives you another useful feature: generating names programmatically by using`:=` instead of `=`. There are two basics forms, as illustrated below with `tibble()`:
            - >			* If you have the name in an env-variable, you can use glue syntax to interpolate in:
            - >		  ```vala
      - name <- "susan"
      - tibble("{name}" := 2)
      - #> # A tibble: 1 × 1
        - ```
          - -
            - > If the name should be derived from a data-variable in an argument, you can use embracing syntax:
              - >		  ```php
      - my_df <- function(x) {
      - tibble("{{x}}_2" := x * 2)
      - }
        - ```

            - > ## Tidy selection[](#tidy-selection)
              - Data masking makes it easy to compute on values within a dataset. Tidy selection is a complementary tool that makes it easy to work with the columns of a dataset.
              - ### The tidyselect DSL[](#the-tidyselect-dsl)
              - Underneath all functions that use tidy selection is the [tidyselect](https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/) package. It provides a miniature domain specific language that makes it easy to select columns by name, position, or type. For example:
              - >			* `select(df, 1)` selects the first column;`select(df, last_col())` selects the last column.
            - `select(df, c(a, b, c))` selects columns`a`, `b`, and `c`.
            - `select(df, starts_with("a"))` selects all columns whose name starts with “a”; `select(df, ends_with("z"))`selects all columns whose name ends with “z”. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/programming-with-dplyr-dplyr-18deea23357#e80c2bdc-605c-4a17-baf6-d909de3995a9)
          - -
            - > `select(df, where(is.numeric))` selects all numeric columns. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/programming-with-dplyr-dplyr-18deea23357#97d80d79-c813-4e7d-8f70-834dec10d4fd)
          - -
            - > When you have an env-variable that is a character vector, you need to use `all_of()` or `any_of()` depending on whether you want the function to error if a variable is not found.

          - > When it comes to visual design, a related signal trademark of Tanović cinematography, consistent across the different cinematographers he has worked with throughout the years, is the use of close-ups and *extreme* close-ups on human features, with a special focus on hands. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/style-as-political-substance-or-the-bosnian-master-the-case-for--18dec6e0ffd#f49efbd1-ba59-4df6-a0a7-88c33b2904a9)

          - > *Cirkus Columbia* is available for $3.99 on both Amazon Prime and Apple TV Plus. Set on the brink of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1991, the expatriate Divko Buntić (Miki Manoklović) returns home to his small idyllic town in Herzegovina (specifically, the southern part of the country) and disrupts the lives of those around him in the process in a deeply sensual summer film where the political violently collides into the mundane. The effects of Yugoslavia’s breakup and subsequent onset of war are distilled in the complicated relations of one family, complete with a parable-esque and borderline incestuous relationship. Not unlike the great novels of Gabriel García Márquez, Halldór Laxness, or Günter Grass, watching a Tanović film demands relating the local to the national, the fictional landscapes to actual geography, and the personal to the political.

As of today, any potential screening requires a VPN to find the film, which is set in Hotel Europa on the centenary of Gavrilo Princip’s assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, as the past-prestige hotel prepares to host a delegation of European Union diplomatic VIPs.

      - Boyd was a model and an icon of swinging London in the 1960s, marrying Harrison in 1966 after meeting him on the set of Beatles film A Hard Day’s Night – she claimed he wrote the Beatles ballad Something about her, though he later denied it.

He refers to Boyd as “Layla” and that year wrote the classic rock song of the same name about her. After he played her a cassette recording of Layla, Boyd says: “I was taken aback by its beauty – but at the same time I felt guilt.”Add notes to this highlight...
      - Boyd and Harrison split in 1974 due to his multiple infidelities. She and Clapton barely saw each other until the middle of the decade, when they reconnected and eventually married in 1979. He wrote other songs about her, including Wonderful Tonight, a doting ballad written during – and about – Boyd’s preparations for a night out.

      - The Tory party is a party of #kk
        - rentiers for rentiers; its electorate is old and propertied. Once the party of British national capitalism, of big business, before it undid the very bases on which it depended, it no longer acts as the agent of productive change. Its aim is essentially to transfer resources from young to old, from workers to rentiers, from poor to rich; to support the landlord, the property developer and the extractive monopolies. Far from being incompetent, it has been extraordinarily successful in pursuing its agenda. It has no interest or competence in promoting a successful, transformative, decarbonised capitalism; indeed it shows a remarkably inadequate understanding of the dynamics of modern capitalism.
