- **The Emergent Structure (The "River"):** This lobby becomes a dominant force in US politics. Politicians from *both* parties learn that cutting benefits is political suicide. The policy has created its own powerful support system, "locking in" its own existence.
      - **Why it's a Systems Approach:** It shows how a policy (a "rule") changes the behavior of agents (voters, politicians), who then feed back to protect that rule, creating a stable, self-perpetuating system (path dependency) that was not designed or intended by the original creators.

        - [no hidden systems levers](https://workflowy.com/#/8a9aa308bb93) thanks for that … but my problem with any approach that says “here are the secret levers which have immense influence on the system, the boring technocrats couldn’t see them but we can: just press these levers” is that, if they work half-way reliably, then they are part of the system, aren’t they? Who drew the boundaries so narrow as not to include them?
        - What I’d agree with is that there are plenty of traditional templates for describing a system which don’t even mention processes for goal-setting, rule-setting, “buffer size” and certainly don’t encourage you to include them on your map of your system. But who’d follow that poor advice?
    - Bob Williams - argument with Ricardo about how to define the boundaries - Ricardo says they are defined by intended use for intended users. Bob says no it is the consequences xk read up on this. I say, this is why Ghislain is wrong: the social consequences of evaluation are not just an interesting add-on but an essential part of evaluation.

    - Harari - capitalism is a ponzi scheme #kkk
      - Harari explains that the modern economy is significantly driven by the concept of credit, which allows banks to lend out far more money than they actually possess. This system is based on the trust that future profits will cover the loans. He uses a simple example to illustrate this: if a bank has $1 million in actual cash, it can lend out up to $10 million. This means that 90% of the money in circulation is not backed by physical currency but by the trust in future economic growth.
      - The Ponzi Scheme Analogy
      - Harari likens this system to a Ponzi scheme because it continually requires new investments to pay off previous ones. If at any point, all account holders demand their money simultaneously, the bank would collapse, as it does not have the actual cash to cover all deposits. This dependency on continuous growth and future profits is what makes the system appear similar to a Ponzi scheme.
      - ==Trust in the Future==
      - Despite the seemingly precarious nature of this system, Harari argues that it is not a fraud but a testament to human imagination and trust. The entire capitalist economy is built on the belief that the future will be better and that investments made today will yield profits tomorrow. This trust in the future is what enables banks to lend money and businesses to grow.
      - The Role of Credit and Growth
      - Harari emphasizes that credit and the reinvestment of profits are crucial for the capitalist system. The idea is that profits should be reinvested to generate more profits, creating a cycle of continuous growth. This cycle is essential for the survival and expansion of the modern economy.

      - Sustainable return on investment - Because it includes environmental impacts, S-ROI is distinct from the similarly named methodology of [Social Return on Investment (SROI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_return_on_investment). Basically just weight by probability over time
    - Akerlof's lemon
      - (example of markets which don't work): ==never buy a car which is so cheap it isn't worth having it checked to ensure it isn't a lemon.==
      - Suppose buyers cannot distinguish between a high-quality car (a "peach") and a "lemon". Then they are only willing to pay a fixed price for a car that averages the value of a "peach" and "lemon" together (pavg). But sellers know whether they hold a peach or a lemon. Given the fixed price at which buyers will buy, sellers will sell only when they hold "lemons" (since plemon < pavg) and they will leave the market when they hold "peaches" (since ppeach > pavg). Eventually, as enough sellers of "peaches" leave the market, the average willingness-to-pay of buyers will decrease (since the average quality of cars on the market decreased), leading to even more sellers of high-quality cars to leave the market through a positive feedback loop.
      - Thus the uninformed buyer's price creates an adverse selection problem that drives the high-quality cars from the market. Adverse selection is a market mechanism that can lead to a market collapse.

      - Clifford Geertz is renowned for his interpretive approach to culture, emphasizing the importance of understanding symbols, rituals, and narratives that give meaning to human actions and societies. His method, often described as "[thick description](https://workflowy.com/#/4f54daf4493e) ," seeks to interpret the layers of meaning in social practices, aiming to see cultural phenomena through the eyes of those living within those cultures. Geertz's work is pivotal in moving anthropology towards a more interpretive and less scientifically positivist understanding of culture.
  - Satisficing  #kkkk
    - Traditionally, “satisficing” refers to a cognitive heuristic in which people employ suboptimal decision-making strategies to conserve mental energy (Simon, 1957; Simon & Stedry, 1968). For example, rather than searching for an “optimal” solution, some decision makers select the first satisfactory alternative that seems “close enough,” thereby saving time and effort. Survey scholars have adapted this concept to explain respondents’ suboptimal behaviors (Krosnick, 1991; Tourangeau, 1984). On surveys, satisficing can include selecting the first reasonable response option, agreeing with all the statements presented, selecting the same option repeatedly in a straight line across multiple items, and consistently selecting the “don’t know” or “not applicable” responses

    - Austria after the first world war had a perfect Constitution and you had a social democrat absolute majority in Vienna and possibly in the country and then in I think 1933 in the space of 12 months, the fascist simply dismantled it piece by piece. It didn't take them that long
  - The importance of Britain's support for European courts of Human rights and the council of Europe and as a key architect. #kkkkk 
    - If we were to pull out of that, then it's one of the three or four basic planks of European unity. Probably the most successful political experiment of its kind and don't forget that all the countries that were not in European Union, I think possibly NATO since the second world war. They've all had either wars or major insurrections or tyrannical governments according so they're Rory Stewart podcast

    - “If anyone says that to fight doesn’t get you anywhere, that politics can’t make a difference, that all parties are the same, then look what we’ve achieved together since 1997: the winter fuel allowance, the shortest waiting times in history, crime down by a third, the creation of Surestart, the Cancer Guarantee, record results in schools, more students than ever, the Disability Discrimination Act, devolution, civil partnerships, peace in Northern Ireland, the social chapter, half a million children out of poverty, maternity pay, paternity leave, child benefit, the minimum wage, the ban on cluster bombs, the cancelling of debt, the trebling of aid, the first ever Climate Change Act...
      - That’s the Britain we’ve been building together, that’s the change we choose.”
