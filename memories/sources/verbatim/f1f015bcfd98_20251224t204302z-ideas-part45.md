- The dirtiest, most anti-social and damaging companies have the greatest incentive to invest in politics, as they are the ones most likely to face the heaviest regulation, if exposed to full democratic scrutiny. For this reason, they spend more money on changing political outcomes than any other commercial interests. The result is that politics comes to be dominated by the dirtiest, most anti-social and damaging industries.
    - the capacity to formulate government policy, find the words to make the outrageous sound like common sense (‘Unless the right to strike is rescinded, we’ll never compete with China’, ‘The wealthier those at the top become, the more the rising tide will lift all boats’), and create the impression in the media that there are two sides to even the starkest forms of exploitation (‘The minimum wage inhibits job creation’, ‘The rules preventing river pollution will
    - Conservatives came to power in 2010. As a result, almost 9,000 general and acute beds have been lost in England in the past decade. Whereas the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average is five beds per 1,000 people, the UK capacity is #kkk
      - ==less than half, at 2.4.5==
    - patients on the NHS, they lose money. Since 2006, dentists have worked for the NHS under a contract so ridiculous that it seems designed to fail. They are paid according to ‘units of dental activity’ (UDA), which bear no relation to the costs of treatment.7 Every practice has to meet an annual UDA target. There is no incentive to practise preventive dentistry, and every incentive to exclude the patients with the greatest needs. Nor is there any encouragement for dentists to seek further training and qualifications: they are paid at the UDA rate, regardless of skills and experience.8 So, if you work for the NHS, you can kiss career progression goodbye. To make matters worse, while dental inflation – driven by the rising costs of lab bills, energy, wages and materials – is about 11 per cent a year,9 the funding for NHS dental services has been cut in real terms by 4 per cent a year.10 Broadly speaking, the only dentists still working in the NHS are those who feel a moral obligation to do so, despite losing money and working longer hours. They end up subsidizing their NHS treatments through their private work.
    - trump. But, like Ronald Reagan and The Heritage Foundation, his mission to ‘shrink the state’ was highly selective #kkk
      - he added $133 billion to the 2017–19 defence budgets – a staggering 23 per cent increase. Even military commanders and experts questioned the logic of this expenditure, in a nation that already spends more than the next eight countries combined, three times more than China, and ten times more than Russia.17 Trump came to power through a popular backlash against neoliberalism’s crushing of political choice and its devastating impacts on public well-being.
    - These freeports are places in which the usual rules don’t apply, and citizens have less decision-making power. They’re the equivalent of the royal forests of medieval England. ‘Forest’ in fact derives from the Latin #kkk
      - foris, which means ‘outside’: outside the usual laws of the land. The forests were hunting estates where the king’s private interests overrode the rights of the common people.
    - To ensure any inconvenient public opposition would be minimized, Truss then pushed the Public Order Bill through Parliament, whose purpose was to crush protest.
    - Above a screenshot of a Guardian headline asking, ‘Has Liz Truss handed power over to the extreme neoliberal thinktanks?’, the IEA’s head of public policy, Matthew Lesh, wrote: #kkk
      - ‘Yes’.15 He published a list of the many IEA demands that found their way into her budget.16
    - reliable, charisma-free politicians – now funding this three-ring circus? Why did they want to support middle managers one moment, and jesters the next? The reason is that the nature of capitalism has changed. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the dominant political force in neoliberal nations was #kkkkk
      - corporate power. What corporate power wanted was technocratic government.
      - for business, and secure their profits against democratic change. This force still exists, of course. Corporate power remains a great influence on government and a constraint upon democracy. But it has been mutating into, and become overlain by, another force: #kkkkk
        - oligarchic power.
        - Broadly speaking, there are now two main forms of capitalist enterprise. The first could be described as ==‘housebroken capitalism==’. This domesticated version – companies whose investments might not mature for several years, that rely on certainty and continuity – seeks an accommodation with the administrative state, and benefits from stability, predictability, and the regulations that exclude dirtier and rougher competitors. It can coexist with the light intervention that accompanies a weak form of democracy. The manufacturing and agricultural sectors, for instance, rely on a stable regulatory environment, as well as consistent government policies, such as trade agreements, subsidies and tax incentives. The second could be described as ‘==warlord capitalism==’. This sees all restraints on wealth accumulation – including taxes, regulations and the public ownership of essential services – as illegitimate.
        - ==Although housebroken versus warlord capitalism does not map neatly onto corporate versus oligarchic power, there are clear overlaps.==
    - Occasionally, the warlord capitalists and their political backers say the quiet bit out loud. Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, once confessed: ‘I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.’3 Mike Lee, senior Republican senator for Utah, stated, ‘democracy isn’t the objective’ of the US political system, ‘liberty, peace, and prosperity are’.4 Hayek, as we have already seen, expressed a preference for Pinochet’s dictatorship over what he called ‘a democratic government devoid of liberalism’.
    - Not only has Brexit created turbulence and uncertainty, and dampened economic activity in general, but it has undermined the market advantages #kkkkk
      - for businesses that play by the rules. Without regulatory constraints, the warlords would wipe them out. In response to concerns expressed by the Confederation of British Industry (at the time the most august institution of housebroken capital), Boris Johnson made a remark that might previously have seemed unthinkable, coming from the mouth of a senior Conservative: #kkkkk
        - ‘Fuck business.’
    - The persistent trick of modern politics is to disguise economic and political conflicts as #kkk
      - cultural conflicts. Throughout this saga, the media reported the diversion, not the manoeuvres; the noise, not the signal.
    - But the term ‘conspiracy theory’ is a misnomer. There are plenty of genuine conspiracies:
    - What we tend to call ‘conspiracy theories’ are actually #kkkk
      - conspiracy fictions. Conspiracy fictions are stories about alleged conspiracies for which there is no evidence.
    - So, in promoting conspiracy fictions, you get the best of all possible worlds: self-aggrandizement, reassurance and freedom from civic responsibility. This may explain why those who take an interest in conspiracy fictions are often so uninterested in genuine conspiracies.
    - There has long been an overlap between certain New Age and far-right ideas. The Nazis embraced #kkk
      - astrology, 
      - pagan festivals, organic farming, forest conservation, ecological education and nature worship. They promoted 
      - homoeopathy and ‘natural healing’, and tended to 
      - resist vaccination.
    - The Tea Party movement, launched in February 2009, mobilized unwitting participants against what was characterized as an ‘elite power grab’. By this, they were referring to Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms, climate policies and other attempts – feeble and diluted as they were – to roll back the most obscene excesses of neoliberalism. The official version of events claims that the movement was launched by CNBC reporter Rick Santelli, who called from the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for traders to hold a ‘Tea Party’
    - claimed to be, a spontaneous uprising of concerned citizens. In reality, it was largely engineered by Americans for Prosperity (AFP),8 yet another organization founded and funded by the Koch brothers. AFP provided the Tea Party movement’s key organizing tools. The moment Santelli started speaking on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Americans for Prosperity launched its Tea Party Facebook page and started organizing Tea Party events: none of it was coincidental.
    - further Tea Party events. The Tea Party, in other words, was classic Astroturf #kkk
      - an operation that purports to be a spontaneously organized grassroots movement, but in reality is founded, funded and facilitated by elite interests. The Tea Party movement would become the organizational focus of resistance to the Obama presidency.
    - The great irony here is that fake stories about shadowy elites are routinely propagated #kkk
      - by bona fide shadowy elites, such as the Koch brothers and their Americans for Prosperity network.
    - After the parties of the left fell into line with corporate power, the right seized the language they had abandoned. Now we see an almost perfect language swap. #kkk
      - Parties that once belonged on the left talk about ‘security’ and ‘stability’, whereas those on the right talk of ‘liberation’ and ‘revolt’.
    - At the same time, power is drained from the nation state. Its ability to collect taxes, defend workers and regulate capital contracts. As the academics Reijer Hendrikse and Rodrigo Fernandez argue, offshore finance involves ‘the rampant unbundling and commercialization of state sovereignty’,3 and the shifting of power into a secretive, extraterritorial legal space,
    - however, is that this ‘invisible hand’ can have the opposite effect. When the banks were deregulated – in line with neoliberal theory – the policy was supported by Democrats and Republicans, Labour and the Conservatives alike.
    - Even Alan Greenspan, the chair of the US Federal Reserve, who had literally sat at Ayn Rand’s knee6 (he was a devoted member of her inner circle, founder-member of the Ayn Rand Collective, and adherent of her ‘objectivist’ philosophy, which has much in common with neoliberalism, though it is even more extreme), found himself obliged to concede his ‘mistake’.
    - Governments were able, as if by magic, to forestall financial collapse in 2008 by conjuring up future money: a process they called ‘quantitative easing’, #kkkkk
      - in which a central bank buys up government bonds to stimulate the economy and increase the money supply. But you cannot prevent the collapse of our food system by conjuring up future food.
    - Between 2013 and 2018, the United Kingdom spent almost twice as much on sealing its borders as it did on climate finance.
      - The United States spent eleven times, Australia thirteen times, and Canada fifteen times
    - Through yet another counterintuitive hustle, consumerism – the presenting problem – is also presented as the answer. We are inculcated with the belief that we don’t need to stop consuming – in fact, we need to keep consuming, just ‘consume better’.
    - The oil industry’s hypocrisy apparently knows no bounds. In 2019, Shell Oil’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, gave a speech instructing us to #kkk
      - ‘eat seasonally and recycle more’.5 He publicly berated his chauffeur for buying strawberries in January,
    - As the demand for oil for vehicles is likely to decline, #kkkkk
