- reduction in poverty since 2000 #kk
    - problem of means
    - has been achieved in just a handful of countries. In fact, between 2002 and 2011, just five countries accounted for over 85% of the reduction in the extreme poverty rate
- philosophy
  - What do you call the fact that it is easier to agree about what something is not than what it is? #kkkkk 
    - via negativa. goes back to Socrates and aristotle and then Apophatic Theology (Negative Theology): and also recently Taleb (easier to agree what is bad for you than what is good for you, eg food)
  - Wittgenstein
    - surveyability in [Kant](https://workflowy.com/#/38b6bd9e7416)  & [Wittgenstein](https://workflowy.com/#/893c2829fedb) #kk
      - There is a difference between Kantian exhibition and Wittgensteinian surveyability — I don’t mean to conflate the two, or to suggest that Wittgenstein was simply following Kant, which he was not — but for the moment I want to focus on what they have in common, and what they have in common is the attempt to see matters whole, i.e., to take in the object of one’s thought in a single glance. In the actual practice of seeing matters whole it is a bit more complicated, especially since in English we commonly use “see” to mean “understand,” and there are a whole range of visual metaphors for understanding.

  - Kant antinomies #kkkk
    - two ideas which are both right but incompatible
    - critique of pure reason
    - Third Antinomy (Antinomy of Freedom)
      - Thesis: Causality according to the laws of nature is not the only causality from which the appearances of the world can be derived. To explain these appearances, it is necessary to assume another causality, that of freedom.
      - Argument: Human beings experience moral obligations and freedom in their actions. This suggests the existence of a type of causality that is not determined by natural laws, namely free will.
      - Antithesis: There is no freedom; everything in the world happens solely according to the laws of nature.
      - Argument: Everything in the world can be explained through the deterministic laws of nature. Introducing the concept of freedom would disrupt this causal order and lead to contradictions.
  - Derrida 
    - compare with bayes #kk
      - Yes, you could draw an analogy between Derrida's approach to meaning and the Bayesian probability distribution. Just as a Bayesian perspective considers a range of probabilities rather than a single fixed point, Derrida's deconstruction considers multiple interpretations and meanings rather than a single, fixed meaning. This perspective encourages us to remain open to various possible meanings and understandings, recognizing that interpretation is complex and context-dependent, much like how Bayesian statistics account for uncertainty and variability in probabilities. [bayes](https://workflowy.com/#/1f7a624321e4) 
        - Yes, if you were on a committee to write the text for a new national anthem, thinking like a Bayesian would be useful. You would need to be aware that the text could have multiple meanings and interpretations over time. This awareness would help you craft a text that can resonate with different audiences and contexts, acknowledging that meanings will evolve and vary depending on how and when the anthem is read and sung.
    - LLMs: it's like Derrida because each text can be resonates and it's meanings in a million different directions at once a humungous overlay of context and subcontext and speak a characteristics from town and all the different dimensions of content and it's also like Derrida because indeed context is important but you can just add the contacts to the text to get a longer text and the machine comes back having interpreted for you this new longer text has just another point in the same meaning space of the wilder and many dimensions and there's a different pattern of activation of the groups of neurons so you can never really escape the text and I guess his idea of difference is there to in the sense that all you can do is just recently chase the text adding context
    - Example for how he is right over originalists #k
      - be for example in a constitution it talks about marriage without perhaps ever setting out that this has to be between the man and woman and that's the way it's used but it later times marriage comes to me also say sex couples that's fine even though it obviously wasn't what the originators of the situation thank you violently disagree with our current
    - différance #kk
      - Derrida's concept of "différance" plays on the French words "différer," meaning both "to differ" and "to defer." It suggests that meaning is always deferred, never fully present or fixed, because words gain meaning through their differences from other words. This idea challenges the notion of stable, singular meanings, emphasizing instead the fluid and dynamic nature of language and meaning. "Différance" highlights that meaning is constantly shifting and evolving, influenced by context and interpretation.
      - Let's consider the word "home." Traditionally, it refers to a place where one lives. However, according to Derrida's "différance," ==the meaning of "home" is shaped by its difference from words like "house," "shelter," and "dwelling==." Additionally, ==its meaning is deferred because "home" can evoke different feelings and associations depending on context, culture, and personal experiences. Thus, the meaning of "home" is not fixed but continuously evolving and influenced by various factors==.
        - You're right; the idea that words gain meaning through contrast with other words has been discussed by many linguists, notably #kk
          - ;Ferdinand de Saussure. Derrida's "différance" builds on this but goes further by emphasizing that meaning is also constantly deferred and never fully present. He suggests that meaning is always in flux and never fixed, adding a layer of complexity to how we understand language and interpretation. This introduces a dynamic and fluid view of meaning, beyond just the contrasts between words.

    - Older adults who take up drawing could enhance their memory, according to a new study.  Researchers from the University of Waterloo found that even if people weren’t good at it, drawing, as a method to help retain new information, was better than re-writing notes, visualization exercises or passively looking at images.From [Drawing is better than writing for memory retention | Waterloo News | University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/news/news/drawing-better-writing-memory-retention)

      - spiritualists, some of them evangelical Christians, who were convinced that near-death experiences were genuine sojourns in the land of the dead and divine. As researchers, the spiritualists’ aim was to collect as many reports of near-death experience as possible, and to proselytise society about the reality of life after death. Moody was their most important spokesman; he eventually claimed to have had multiple past lives and built a “psychomanteum” in rural Alabama where people could attempt to summon the spirits of the dead by gazing into a dimly lit mirror.
