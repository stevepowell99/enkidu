      - interesting, Fiona - I hadn't been thinking that way round. You are talking about "how can we identify a story within causal mapping data and actually code creatively and somehow rigorously or at least in a trustworthy way (but not reproducibly) to bring out and visualise that story". - which as we discussed isn't something an AI can do (yet). A big added value of BathSDR!  And what do we need to add to bare causal links (e.g. valence, or the idea of aspirational links and chains) to make the story interesting.I was thinking (as usual) more from a formal point of view: we can assume that the deliberately limited vocabulary of causal mapping is too sparse to capture what ever it is that makes stories compelling (without artful intervention by creative coders) .... so, what are the minimum features you would have to add to be able to capture the storiness of a story? To recall, our causal mapping uses a particularly limited vocabulary because this way we have the best chance of being able to aggregate multiple stories, which is much harder when you expand the vocabulary.That brings me to a question which really would interest me and that is: what are stories and storytelling like on a medium or even large N basis - If you try to causally map *all *of the Grimms fairy tales you just get a grey soup, don't you? If you use causal mapping on a large data set in such a way that an overall story emerges, how can one see that from a storytelling point of view? Are there analogues of this process in real life anywhere? Most Significant Change doesn't look for an aggregated story, it picks the most significant one. Netflix doesn't (yet) provide stories which are aggregates of the most popular ones.Can assume that the interestingness, the storiness, of our aggregated causal maps is lower than that of the constituent individual stories?
      - The corollary would be that our most important causal mapping output should be the single most typical story, retold with labels derived from the global dataset, highlighting how their story shares common important features and pathways but retaining the individual original storiness.

    - US vaccination disinformation two examples #kkk
      - How, then, would the US describe the effects of its own disinformation at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic? A shocking new report has revealed that its military ran a secret campaign to discredit China’s Sinovac vaccine with Filipinos – when nothing else was available to the Philippines. The [Reuters investigation](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-covid-propaganda/) found that this spread to audiences in central Asia and the Middle East, with fake social media accounts not only questioning Sinovac’s efficacy and safety but also claiming it used pork gelatine, to discourage Muslims from receiving it. In the case of the Philippines, the poor take-up of vaccines contributed to one of the highest death rates in the region. Undermining confidence in a specific vaccine can also contribute to broader vaccine hesitancy. The campaign, conducted via Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (now X) and other platforms, was launched under the Trump administration despite the objections of multiple state department officials. The Biden administration ended it after the national security council was alerted to the issue in spring 2021.

      - the US has seen what happens when it plays strategic games with vaccination. In 2011, in preparation for the assassination of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the CIA tried to confirm that it had located him by gathering the DNA of relatives through a [staged hepatitis B vaccination campaign](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/150227-polio-pakistan-vaccination-taliban-osama-bin-laden). The backlash was [entirely predictable](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-cia-fake-vaccination-campaign-endangers-us-all/), especially in an area that had already seen claims that the west was using polio vaccines to sterilise Pakistani Muslim girls. NGOs were vilified and polio vaccinators were [murdered](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/08/polio-workers-nigeria-shot-dead). Polio resurged in Pakistan; Islamist militants in Nigeria killed vaccinators subsequently.

Swedish media outlets have reported on nationalist “troll farms” in the past, but ==a TV4 journalist spent a year working undercover at the communications department of the Sweden Democrats. The channel said it was able to confirm at least 23 social media accounts run anonymously from the department. In just three months, posts from these accounts got 27m views across social media platforms. The reporting suggests that this is the tip of an iceberg of misinformation and ultra-nationalist hate speech coming straight out of the publicly funded offices of a party on which the governing coalition relies for support==. In hidden camera shots, party strategists were also seen coordinating secret attacks on political opponents, including conservatives who were deemed insufficiently loyal to the Sweden Democrats’ cause. What was truly remarkable wasn’t the revelations of anonymous accounts, but the r==esponse from the Sweden Democrats leader, Jimmie Åkesson, in a so-called “speech to the nation”. Åkesson not only refused to apologise, but also launched a fierce attack on the news media. The entire programme, he claimed, was disinformation==;

      - If your main purpose is to confirm a hypothesis (e.g. that at least 75% of respondents have benefitted from a project) then the number of randomly selected cases needed to increase your confidence from, for example, 50% sure to 95% sure, can be ... #kkkk
        - “Dion (1998) uses Bayes’ Rule to demonstrate that if a researcher starts out indifferent about whether X is a necessary condition for Y, and just five randomly selected country case studies all reveal X did indeed precede Y, then confidence in the causal claim rises from 50% to 95%.” Copestake (2020).

        - what else does Bayesian [bayes](https://workflowy.com/#/1f7a624321e4) theory add #kkk 
        - Yes, you could draw an analogy between Derrida's approach to meaning and the Bayesian probability distribution. Just as a Bayesian perspective considers a range of probabilities rather than a single fixed point, Derrida's deconstruction considers multiple interpretations and meanings rather than a single, fixed meaning. This perspective encourages us to remain open to various possible meanings and understandings, recognizing that interpretation is complex and context-dependent, much like how Bayesian statistics account for uncertainty and variability in probabilities.

      - what else does Bayesian [bayes](https://workflowy.com/#/1f7a624321e4) theory add #kkk 
        - it deals in prob distributions, not point estimates: Bayesian theory calls for the use of the posterior predictive distribution to do predictive inference, i.e., to predict the distribution of a new, unobserved data point. That is, ==instead of a fixed point as a prediction, a distribution over possible points is returned. ==Only this way is the entire posterior distribution of the parameter(s) used. ==By comparison, prediction in frequentist statistics often involves finding an optimum point estimate of the parameter(s)—e.g., by maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP)—and then plugging this estimate into the formula for the distribution of a data point. This has the disadvantage that it does not account for any uncertainty in the value of the parameter, and hence will underestimate the variance of the predictive distribution.==From [Bayesian inference - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference)
  - AI/NLP/LLMs
    - The key distinction between agent-based and agentic AI in 2025 comes down to architecture versus behavior. #kkk
      - ?
      - Agent-based AI refers to the system's structure. It describes an architecture where a system is built from multiple, independent software components called "agents." These agents have their own states and interact with each other to solve a larger problem. Think of it as a team of specialized workers, each with a specific role.
      - ?
      - Agentic AI refers to the system's behavior. It describes an AI that exhibits a high degree of autonomy, proactivity, and goal-directed reasoning. An agentic system doesn't just respond to direct commands; it can understand a high-level goal, break it down into steps, make decisions, adapt to new information, and act independently to achieve that goal.
      - ?
      - In essence, a system can be constructed with an agent-based architecture but not be particularly "agentic" if its components only follow simple, predefined rules. Conversely, a single, monolithic AI model can be highly "agentic" if it demonstrates autonomous, goal-driven behavior.

        - the concept of [Gestalt ](https://workflowy.com/#/68ebcb91a499)is not popular in modern psychology because we are hypnotised by this idea of brains as big data computing machines. But Gestalt asks: what is it about the moment of realisation, when the parts come together to form a simple whole? or when we see things as a duck, not as as rabbit?
