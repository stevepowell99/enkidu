            - > Break-even analysis eases the requirements a little, by turning the question on its head. It asks: *What would we have to assume for benefits to equal costs?* or *Can we find enough benefits to equal costs?* It is often feasible to answer these questions when we don’t have enough data for a comprehensive CBA.

            - julian replied:
              - it's rare to do a CBA that has all the data you need to quantify, attribute, and monetise benefits. To start with, it would have to be an ex-post CBA whereas most CBAs are ex-ante. Even the ex-post ones often consider future benefits. So there's basically always 'missing data' necessitating assumptions. I prefer to treat future-facing benefit estimation as scenario analysis rather than 'prediction', which includes considering multiple scenarios and the range of estimates they produce. Uncertainty is therefore a given, but sometimes we're missing a crucial piece of data and the uncertainty becomes so great that (in my view) it's more robust and honest to shift the focus of the CBA from NPV estimation to break-even analysis. Common examples include: i) being able to estimate the value of 'one unit of benefits', (e.g., for one person) but not knowing how many people to apply it to; or ii) being able to estimate an overall benefit at, say, national level but not knowing how much of the total benefit is attributable to a specific intervention.

          - > The analysis estimated that between 60-70 clients each year were able to sustain a lifestyle free from alcohol and drug-related harm for 12 months after completing the program.
            - It wasn’t possible to compare these outcomes with a similar group of people who had not received treatment, but we ascertained that the observational evidence met Bradford Hill criteria of strength, consistency, temporality, dose-response gradient, and coherence with published evidence (I’ll dive into the Bradford Hill criteria in a future post). This analysis didn’t rule out the potential influence of factors outside the program, but did indicate that the trends observed in the data were consistent with the pattern that should be expected in an effective [therapeutic community]([https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277019069%5FDe%5FLeon%5FG2010%5FIs%5Fthe%5FTherapeutic%5FCommunity%5Fan%5FEvidence%5FBased%5FTreatment%5FWhat%5Fthe%5FEvidence%5FSays%5FInternational%5FJournal%5Fof%5FTherapeutic%5FCommunities%5F31%5F2%5Fsummer%5F104-128](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277019069%5FDe%5FLeon%5FG2010%5FIs%5Fthe%5FTherapeutic%5FCommunity%5Fan%5FEvidence%5FBased%5FTreatment%5FWhat%5Fthe%5FEvidence%5FSays%5FInternational%5FJournal%5Fof%5FTherapeutic%5FCommunities%5F31%5F2%5Fsummer%5F104-128)).
            - #### Potential benefits
            - CBA involves valuing benefits and costs in units of money. Examples of potential benefits of recovery from alcohol and other drug addiction include:
            - >			* Public and private economic benefits (e.g., people who recover from alcohol or drug addiction are able to participate more meaningfully in employment, training and education, and this contributes to economic productivity as well as their own incomes)
          - Reduced costs to taxpayers (e.g., those who successfully complete treatment and remain abstinent [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-juliankingnz-substack-com-p-break-even-analysis-and-rubric-18e3706ebb0#c183f71f-0bd4-4ae2-8030-c47f8d8c0c56)
        - -
          - > Based on these proportions, together with the substance-specific estimates of social costs from the *Drug Harm Index*, we estimated a **weighted average of $81,600** per Higher Ground service user per year. This figure represents the potential reduction in social costs when a person remains drug-free for a year after completing the program.
            - #### Break-even analysis
            - Reduced burden of alcohol and drug-related harm on society could not be directly measured and attributed to the program using available data, but could be explored through break-even analysis.
            - The program operated on bed funding of approximately $3 million per year. At an average benefit of $81,600 per person per year, the **program would break even if it made a critical difference to 37 people** remaining free from drug and alcohol-related harm for 12 months after completing treatment ($3m / $81,600 = 36.8).

            - How would you rate this program’s break-even prospects? Here’s a rubric that I often use to support the process of making evaluative judgements in break-even analysis. The first column provides generic definitions for four levels of performance, and the second column applies these definitions to break-even analysis.
