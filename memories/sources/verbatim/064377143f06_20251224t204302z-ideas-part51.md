            - From [The comeback of the case study?. Bent Flyvbjerg’s article on… | by Thomas Aston | Jan, 2023 | Medium](https://thomasmtaston.medium.com/the-comeback-of-the-case-study-461c441fe89d)
        - [[is small N a small number of observations]]
        - -[[is a case supposed to be representative]]
        - When I say that these are instances of a similar group, I’m adopting Ingo Rohlfing’s argument that comparing case studies requires at least some degree of causal homogeneity. This is a key part of what makes a case relevant to answer your research/evaluation question(s). Not all case studies are about a particular outcome (or outcomes), but it could well be argued that “causal” case studies in evaluation are. For this reason, I also take Beach and Pedersen’s (generative) emphasis on a causal process which plays out and links a cause (or set of causes) with an outcome.

    - [Clifford Geertz](https://workflowy.com/#/c9c17cf3d94b) 's  #kkk
      - [Interpretive Anthropology](https://workflowy.com/#/dd5372bdb9b9) : Geertz introduced the concept of cultures as systems of symbols and meanings, profoundly influencing how anthropologists understand and interpret cultural practices. His work, particularly the study of the Balinese cockfight, demonstrated how deep ethnographic analysis could reveal the symbolic underpinnings of social actions and institutions.
        - difference between Geertz and [Levi Strauss](https://workflowy.com/#/ab08cf769f57)  #kkk
          - Clifford Geertz is renowned for his interpretive approach to culture, emphasizing the importance of understanding symbols, rituals, and narratives that give meaning to human actions and societies. His method, often described as "[thick description](https://workflowy.com/#/4f54daf4493e) ," seeks to interpret the layers of meaning in social practices, aiming to see cultural phenomena through the eyes of those living within those cultures. Geertz's work is pivotal in moving anthropology towards a more interpretive and less scientifically positivist understanding of culture.
          - Claude Lévi-Strauss, on the other hand, is a key figure in structural anthropology and is known for his analysis of the underlying structures of human society and culture, particularly myths and kinship systems. Lévi-Strauss applied structural linguistics to anthropology, positing that all human societies share a common cognitive structure that shapes cultures. This approach aims at uncovering universal patterns of human thought and culture.
        - Geertz was born on August 23, 1926, in San Francisco. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II before pursuing higher education. Geertz graduated from Antioch College in Ohio in 1950 with a BA in philosophy, and he later received his Ph.D. in anthropology from Harvard University in 1956, where he was influenced by the works of Talcott Parsons, among others. His doctoral research took him to Java, Indonesia, which, along with subsequent work in Bali and Morocco, would form the basis of much of his influential writing.
        - Key Contributions  #kkkk
          - Geertz's approach to anthropology was part of a broader shift in the social sciences towards ==interpretivism==, an approach that emphasizes understanding ==the subjective experiences and meanings that individuals and communities **attribute **to their social world==. He was ==critical of anthropological approaches that sought to generalize cultures based on abstract models or theories==, arguing instead for the importance of detailed, contextualized studies.
