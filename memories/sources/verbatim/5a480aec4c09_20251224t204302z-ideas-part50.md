- This is a fascinating article doing something I'd always wanted to try -- using causal mapping (these are literally causal maps, though they don't use the term) in understanding psychotherapy patients' understanding of the causal mechanisms around a problem. Apparently there is a network model in clinical psychology which seeks to explain pathology from a systems point of view: ==a symptom is not an indicator of an underlying latent disorder but an item in a causal network which has got stuck in the sense of having unhelpful positive feedback loops. ==
          - 
          - They use a ==highly structured method to elicit individual maps (asking respondents to pick links from an exhaustive list of all possible connections between predefined items ==- a method that goes back at least to Bougon in 1977). Clinicians found the maps really useful, and one obvious use would be in therapy to target nodes with high centrality or high outdegree centrality (the ones on the left of our diagrams in Causal Map). They don't really try to combine the networks, but they do report things which individual networks had in common, remarking for example that rumination and worrying were commonly central in depression, even though they are not defining criteria in the definition of depression.,
          - Might write to them re the idea of doing the same thing via causal mapping interview. It would be really interesting to see how the same thing would work if you asked for different stories of how, say, a depressive episode developed, rather than asking in general what do you think causes what. And of course you'd get emerging items rather than pre-defined ones. But you'd probably get fewer feedback loops as the narrative direction would probably be more linear. Steff,  I looped you in because you'd been talking about using causal or systems mapping approaches in this kind of way, if I remember correctly.CheersSteve

        - There have been proposals to employ such structures to support the structuring of multicriteria evaluation models, within an additive value measurement framework. However, a drawback of this multi-methodological modelling is the loss of richness of interactions along the meansend chains when evaluating options. This has led to the development of methods that make use of the structure of the map itself to evaluate options, such as the Reasoning Maps method, which employs ordinal scales and ordinal operators for such evaluation. However, despite their potential, Reasoning Maps cannot model explicitly value interactions nor perform a quantitative ranking of options, limiting their applicability and usefulness. In this article we propose extending the Reasoning Maps approach through a multilinear evaluation model structure, built with the MACBETH multicriteria method.” Yellow Highlight [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHWV88UF?page=1&annotation=526XKDLR)
        - Causal maps with an ideographic nature, which represent subjective knowledge by depicting the beliefs and concerns of a decision-maker (DM) or groups of DMs (Eden & Ackermann, 1998b), have been extensively employed in Operational Research for supporting problem structuring and complex decision-making processes (Eden, 1994; Eden & Ackermann, 2001, 2013b; Franco & Lord, 2011)” Yellow Highlight [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UHWV88UF?page=1&annotation=CTF4SPYB)
