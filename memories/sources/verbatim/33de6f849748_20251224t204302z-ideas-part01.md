- **ex-ante** and **ex-post** #kkk
  - The fundamental difference lies in their purpose: **Ex-ante is about prediction and selection** (should we do this?), while **ex-post is about accountability and learning** (did it work?).

    - ## causal pathways/ mapping and simplicity
      - Hi, just responding briefly to [Giel Ton](https://dynalist.io/d/htLhi8yfGx0xD4quFcR5HQCl#z=BcXwUSoWGZKMarSFivCuUv0X) Giel, I really like what you say about simplicity and not getting too pulled in the direction of the very mathematical aspects of say QCA and PT (and especially FCM etc), or overinterpreting results from data of mixed quality. Perhaps that is a way of distinguishing our "offer": how to marshall common-sense intuitions in order to do causal reasoning "lite" in ways that are plausible and can help with decision-making even if the idea of "rigour" doesn't quite fit.  I'd argue that OH is successful because it is one way to do exactly this. People understand how OH is supposed to provide plausible arguments using their ordinary intuitions and without learning any new maths.Causal mapping in the narrower sense is designed to assemble data (causal claims) of different types from different sources to at least answer questions like "how many sources mentioned any kind of a causal path from X to Z" or "how many paths are there if we only look at paths where the sources were at least fairly sure about all the links in the paths?" etc. I don't know if that's methods bricolage, maybe it is data bricolage. So Giel, you're suggesting that each one of us write a half-pager on the theme of, say, "how to help foundations and others do causal reasoning / make plausible contributions to a decision like where shall we invest in order to help children, making the best of (potentially/possibly) causal information already available or at least fairly easy to gather: to improve the kind of causal reasoning that everyone ends up doing anyway - without overselling any kind of new statistics or super-complicated new approaches"?I'd be up for [that.It](http://that.it/)'s worrying how often it happens that I might write something and a client says OMG YOU USED THE WORD CAUSATION DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT WAS BANNED UNLESS YOU HAVE A PHD IN XYZ -- DELETE IT IMMEDIATELY - and yet, people go on thinking (implicity) causally, you have to, to make any decision. Can we lighten this up a bit, address this need?

      - Dialog
        - ‘The evaluator is not a social activist but one who knows how to bridge between contradictory contributions without giving a priori advantage to one or the other.’
        - This is Bojan's nice review of review of “Transformational Evaluation for the Global Crises of Our Times”. I like the idea of an evaluator bridging contradictory contributions rather than either as a social activist or as someone who invites "[#participation](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=participation&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6948597453612843008)". (After all, "participation" usually ends up being about inviting outsiders to join some parts of an insider process. Whereas I think what Bojan is talking about is something different: facilitating a dialogue between voices who are, at least for the duration of the dialogue, equals.) [value](https://dynalist.io/d/p3tC8OcxIpIcIuTyW6PvIRi8#z=_NMCzwUir4lVlTrsor-ntINp)
        - As a psychologist, this view of "transformation" sounds to me exactly like the dialogical principle in [#Gestalt](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=gestalt&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6948597453612843008) psychotherapy.
        - I'm assuming that the evaluator's fundamental skill is knowing how to facilitate this dialogue of positions and values rather than in thinking up a resolution of a contradiction all on her own.
        - I wonder what you think about citizens' assemblies [Bojan Radej](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAMQiiwBF5ry3IoKNrq0-WGhcAU92tOA9Ck)? They do serve this function of getting different voices into the same room on the same terms.
        - This all also suggests that solving a problem like climate change does mean building and reinforcing bridges, a shared language and values, even and especially with those massive and profoundly criminal and ecocidal corporations.
        - Of course, evaluators might have to play the role of social activists even to insist on getting different voices into the room, or even when they insist on valuing different voices. This can take an activist flavour when insisting that the oppressed or excluded are listened to, but it also means listening to powerful actors too, perhaps in a different way. Perhaps problems as profound as climate change are not just a battle between good guys and bad guys, perhaps there is a fractal fragment of Shell or a BP inside each one of us, and inside each family and community, and perhaps establishing a dialogue between actors on a public stage can help re-invent this dichotomy, between innocent victims and all-powerful aggressors.

      - dave snowdon on stories: xl
        - "On the other hand if you involve employees from the start then that knowledge is already present.  When we do this work we capture narratives of what is, what has been learnt, what could be and so on from, ideally all of the workforce, over a week or so initially but then as continuous capture.   We then initiate mapping at the level of competence to act (a team, the organisation a whole, a geographical location etc. etc.) and while we give a sense of direction (typically by looking at the narrative map and asking how can we get more stories like these and fewer like those) we allow a significant proportion of the initiatives to be local, ideally recorded and shared but nor directed.  Learning needs to be peer to peer as much as it is mediated"

        - [Gary](file:///C:/Users/steve/AppData/Local/Programs/RemNote/resources/app.asar/build/doc/dtir3ZwbygibpzAnE)'s find - project to make standard graphs from International Relations, similar to Axelrod↔[FAQs – Visual International Relations Project](http://visualinternationalrelationsproject.com/help/)
          - How intriguing! An ambitious project.
          - The use of surrounding boxes to mark micro and macro levels is nice.I like also the distinction between implicit and inferred links.
          - I note that the rules for node symbols is mostly about marking differences in the positions of nodes in the graph ("divergent", "convergent" etc) which you can see anyway if you inspect the graph.
          - Nice that they are very unspecific about what a node has to be, sometimes they are high level concepts, sometimes events, often they are themselves complicated descriptions of causal connections.
          - Similarity between casual factors
            - Looking at this sentence,
            - Gold is increasing
            - I think the following should by default be classed as similar to it:
            - Gold is going higher
            - Gold is accelerating
            - Gold is getting bigger
            - Gold is not going lower [arguable/borderline]
            - Gold is increasing and the sun is hot [arguable/borderline]
            - And these should by default be classed as NOT similar to it:
            - Gold is not going higher
            - Gold is going lower
            - Also some vocabulary tests. These should all be classified as similar, say >.75 ("old" model passes this test too)

    - measurement - scales - concatenation
      - In physics and metrology, the standard definition of measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (de Boer, 1994/95; Emerson, 2008). For example, the statement "Peter's hallway is 4m long" expresses a measurement of an hitherto unknown length magnitude (the hallway's length) as the ratio of the unit (the metre in this case) to the length of the hallway. The real number "4" is a real number in the strict mathematical sense of this term.  For some other quantities, it is easier or has been convention to estimate ratios between attribute differences. Consider temperature, for example. In the familiar everyday instances, temperature is measured using instruments calibrated in either the Fahrenheit or Celsius scales. What are really being measured with such instruments are the magnitudes of temperature differences. For example, Anders Celsius defined the unit of the Celsius scale to be 1/100th of the difference in temperature between the freezing and boiling points of water at sea level. A midday temperature measurement of 20 degrees Celsius is simply the ratio of the Celsius unit to the midday temperature.  Formally expressed, a scientific measurement is:  {\displaystyle Q=r\times [Q]}   where Q is the magnitude of the quantity, r is a real number and [Q] is a unit magnitude of the same kind.From [Theory of conjoint measurement - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_conjoint_measurement)
