- Conservatives’ Online Safety Act intended to curb online hate but risks chilling speech; Ofcom may enforce unevenly (example: GB News vs other broadcasters).
- Long historical pattern of anti-foreigner/anti-minority riots in England (York 1190 onwards) — recurring violence often provoked counter-movements and anti-racist responses.
- Tory immigration rhetoric has backfired; public misperception over illegal vs legal migration persists while most immigration is legal (work, study, care).
- Contemporary Tory variants (Cameron, May, Johnson, Truss, Sunak) have failed to present a sustainable political project; space for further-left voices to shift politics.
- Public attitudes tilt toward economic interventionism: high support for public ownership/regulation, higher taxes for NHS, CEO wage caps, worker representation (Legatum/Populus findings).
- Murdoch’s influence waned after scandals; media figures/patrons like Paul Marshall and outlets (UnHerd, potential Telegraph/Spectator moves) shape the right-of-centre media ecosystem; HTB/evangelical networks noted as influential.

Key quotes:
- "I thought, at last – a voice for those of us who are so sick of the intolerance … the woke brigade." — Michael Grade on Laurence Fox (used to explain perceived regulator bias).
- From Legatum polling summary: strong public support for public ownership of water/electricity/gas/rail and more regulation of labour markets.
