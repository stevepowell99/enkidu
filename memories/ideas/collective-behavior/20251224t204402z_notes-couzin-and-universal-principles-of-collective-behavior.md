- Couzin moved from laborious manual tracking of ants to computer tracking and simulations, treating simulations as an "extension of his brain" to build intuition about swarms.
- Boids' three simple interactions (attraction, repulsion, alignment) produce many macroscopic patterns depending on parameter changes (loose disorder, rotating doughnut, aligned flocking).
- Empirical work: locusts → expanded literature; golden shiners → simple local rule (swim slower in shade) explains collective movement into shade (emergent sensing), contradicting "many wrongs" averaging theory.
- Honeybee house-hunting: waggle dances excite supporters; head-butting acts as a negative feedback/downvote; decisions emerge when support crosses a threshold (literal hive mind analogy).
- Starlings: scale-free correlations among neighbors let information propagate across entire murmuration quickly; simple neighbor-following rules produce large-scale coherence.
- Debate: repeated patterns suggest possible simple underlying algorithms (Wolfram-style), but caution that biology can generate math and domain-specific mechanisms matter; avoid overgeneralizing one equation for all systems.
- Applications/implications: same rule families appear in physics, cell migration, neural systems, and may inform interventions (e.g., steering tumor cell swarms).

Key quotes:
- "I began to view the simulations as an extension of my brain." — Couzin
- "That's purely an emergent property... The sensing ability really happens only at the level of the collective." — Couzin
- "I'm very cautious about suggesting that there'll be an underlying theory that'll explain the stock market and neural systems and fish schools." — Couzin

Why: Useful concise summary of experiments and ideas showing how simple local rules produce complex, repeatable collective behaviors — relevant for modeling and cross-domain analogies.
