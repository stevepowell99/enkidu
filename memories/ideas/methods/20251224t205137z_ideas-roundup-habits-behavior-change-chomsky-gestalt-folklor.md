- Folklore: F. A. Steel's retelling of a fairy tale explains enchantment by an uncut head — explains why two brothers didn't return.
- Linguistics / cognition: Notes on Noam Chomsky (1959 critique of behaviorism) as instigator of the "cognitive revolution" and generative grammar (infinite meanings from finite building blocks).
- Gestalt: interest in the moment of insight (seeing whole rather than parts); attention and Gestalt as tools for scientific discovery and communication.
- Suicide-prevention (Finland): large-scale national initiatives (1986–1996) reduced suicide rates via earlier detection, better treatment, guidelines; seasonal patterns noted (spring peak).
- Behavior-change evidence: large review (Albarracín et al.) finds motivation/skills/knowledge often have negligible impact; greatest effects from targeting habits and making desired behaviours effortless (material incentives, social support, access).
- James Clear / Atomic Habits: summary of core ideas — tiny gains, systems over goals, identity-based habits, Four Laws (Obvious, Attractive, Easy, Satisfying), habit loop, habit stacking, environment design, continuous improvement.
- Cognitive biases & creativity: Dunning–Kruger effect noted; Guilford's Structure of Intellect (divergent vs convergent thinking) relevant to human vs AI creativity debates.

Key quotes:
- "cognitive revolution" — Chomsky's 1959 critique is credited with initiating it.
- Guilford introduced the terms "divergent and convergent thinking" in his Structure of Intellect model.
