- Systems thinking: emergent structures (the "River") can create path dependency where policies become self-protecting via feedback loops and political incentives; Meadows link and critique about purported "hidden levers"; debate on boundary definition (Bob Williams vs Ricardo) — social consequences of evaluation matter.
- US/Mexico border: post-9/11 funding and COVID-era policies (Title 42) changed migration flows; more families/unaccompanied minors and immediate asylum claims stress facilities; perception of disorder drives political unpopularity; partisan incentives shape willingness to solve the problem.
- Economics highlights: Harari's credit-as-Ponzi analogy (trust in the future enables credit-driven growth); Akerlof's "lemon" problem (adverse selection feedback); note on Sustainable ROI (S-ROI) as probability-weighted, time-aware valuation.
- Religion & culture: Islam — five pillars (shahada, salah, zakat, sawm, hajj); I'tikaf and Laylatul Qadr notes; thick description (Clifford Geertz) as an interpretive method for culture.
- Learning & decision heuristics: "See one, do one, teach one" as transition phrasing; satisficing defined (Simon/Krosnick) and survey-related behaviors.
- Geography & miscellany: French Guiana = largest EU national park; half of EU's nine million farms are in Romania; local Clevedon median age ~42–43; assorted regional notes.

Key quotes:
- "The emergent structure (the 'River')...locking in its own existence." (note on policy self-perpetuation)
- Harari paraphrase: modern capitalism can be likened to a Ponzi-like reliance on trust in future growth.
- "That's the Britain we've been building together..." — Gordon Brown (list of policy achievements cited).
