- Reference: Ekert A.K., Phys. Rev. Lett. 67, 661–663 (1991) and related Nature coverage and expert pages (Gisin, Zeilinger, Leifer, Hanson lab).
- Physics: discussion of Bell/CHSH violations (Delft observed S≈2.4) and how quantum mechanics forbids FTL signalling; mention of "information causality" (Pawlowski et al., 2009).
- Conceptual point: Bell's theorem implies any classical hidden-variable story would entail a nonlocal "behind-the-scenes" signaling that is rendered unusable by intrinsic randomness.
- Meta/science-policy thread: caution about media hype and premature celebration of unreviewed results (BICEP2 example); argument that European institutions have recently strengthened in high-quality fundamental science and infrastructure (CERN, ESA, Horizon2020, E-ELT, European XFEL, ESS, ITER, etc.).
- Examples of problematic hype cited: BICEP2, faster-than-light neutrino reversal, arsenic life claim, stem-cell retractions, over-claimed fusion/other tech breakthroughs; concern about incentives and funding leading to premature publicity.
- Misc notes: brief mention of the Overview Effect applied to formal thought and perspective-taking in epistemic contexts.

Key quotes:
- "Nature produces chance events (irreducibly chance-like!) which can occur at widely removed spatial locations ... The chance-like character of these effects prevents any possibility of using this form of non locality to communicate" — Nicolas Gisin.
- Term to remember: "information causality" — a constraint linking information exchange and quantum correlations (Pawlowski et al., 2009).

Why: Captures core quantum/nonlocality notes plus a recurring concern about reproducibility and media hype—useful for later discussions of evidence standards, policy, and research credibility.
