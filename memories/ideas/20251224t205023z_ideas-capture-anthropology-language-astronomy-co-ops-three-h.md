- Nuer / egalitarianism: Evans‑Pritchard framed the Nuer as a paradigm of egalitarian societies; feminist critiques (Kathleen Gough) complicate claims of equal status and reveal gendered power dynamics.
- Cooperatives: Mondragón / Eroski example — member ownership creates different workplace experience and sense of 'it feels like mine'.
- Language: challenge to simple tree model of Indo‑European descent (synchronous heterogeneity possible); claim that all human languages have an imperative form.
- Astronomy: Olbers' paradox used as evidence against a static eternal universe; night‑sky darkness explained by expansion/redshift and CMB.
- Three Horizons: framework to map present (Horizon 1) to desired futures (Horizon 3) with Horizon 2 as transition strategy; used by evaluation community for transformational foresight.
- Misc notes: graphic/layout hierarchy of attention (Hadley); penicillin discovery anecdote (Peoria cantaloupe); assorted cultural/football/German language items for later triage.

Key quotes:
- “even the suspicion of an order riles a man and he either does not carry it out or he carries it out in a casual and dilatory manner that is more insulting than a refusal.”
- “all human languages have an imperative form; … there are no people, even in radically anti‑authoritarian societies like the Hadza, who are entirely unfamiliar with the idea of a command.”
- Clara Zetkin: “The fight of the labouring masses … is the fight for their full liberation.”
