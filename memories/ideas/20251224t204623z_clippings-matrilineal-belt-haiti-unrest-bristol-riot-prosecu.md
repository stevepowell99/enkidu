- Angela Saini note references a widespread “matrilineal belt” across Africa and other matrilineal societies in Asia and the Americas — useful for comparative kinship/power questions.
- The Guardian report on Haiti (Tom Phillips): national breakdown in security — PM Ariel Henry was abroad and unable to return; gangs attacked the airport and prison, and nearly 4,000 inmates escaped.
- The Guardian piece on Bristol protests (Tom Wall): unusually severe legal crackdown — new/expanded offences and penalties, intensive police investigation (111 officers, ~700 hours of footage), 38 charged with riot, 19 convicted; cases of Charly Pitman (sentenced) and Fleur Moody (plea to affray, suspended sentence).
- Notes on how law changes (e.g., increased penalties for damage to memorials; powers to impound live-in vans) intersect with social vulnerabilities (van-dwellers) and protest dynamics.
- Overall thread: contrast between social-structural observations (matriliny) and contemporary crises showing state force and legal power shaping outcomes for populations.

Key quotes:
- "There is an entire 'matrilineal belt' that stretches across Africa, and others dotted across Asia and North and South America."
- "If the criminals escaped, 'no one in the capital will be spared.'"
- "Riot is the most serious public-order offence on the statute books, punishable with up to 10 years in prison... Such charges are extremely rare."

Why: Collects disparate notes showing structural social patterns (matriliny) and contemporary examples of how state power and law shape violence, security, and protest outcomes.
