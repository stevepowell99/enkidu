- Indigenous critique of European religion and civilization: Kandiaronk (and other indigenous voices) argue that if a supreme being had descended, it would have been public and uniform — the persistence of many religions undermines missionary claims.
- Schismogenesis (Gregory Bateson): small disagreements can escalate into mutually defining oppositions; this dynamic operates within and between societies and helps explain polarizing identity formation.
- Contrast between communal sharing and European private property: Europeans tied freedom to private property (Roman paterfamilias legacy); many indigenous systems combined individual liberty with communal expectations of sharing.
- Enlightenment device of the outsider critique: many French thinkers used imagined foreigners (Persian, Chinese, Tahitian, Inca, Wendat) to critique their own society; this fueled debates about progress, freedom, and inequality.
- The ‘noble savage’ story is misunderstood: Rousseau’s ideas were later caricatured; the phrase became a tool of ridicule and racist agendas in the 19th century.
- Gender and social roles are relative: observed societies could appear matriarchal or patriarchal depending on viewpoint; avoid treating ancestors as a monolithic ‘primitive’ stage.
- Prehistory reframed by archaeological finds (Brixham Cave); human deep time is long and evidence sparse — cautions against simplistic evolutionary narratives.

Key quotes:
- “if it were possible that God had lowered his standards sufficiently to come down to earth, he would have done it in full view of everyone, descending in triumph, with pomp and majesty…”
- “Back in the 1930s, the anthropologist Gregory Bateson coined the term ‘schismogenesis’ to describe people’s tendency to define themselves against one another.”
- “To Americans like Kandiaronk, there was no contradiction between individual liberty and communism…”

Why: Concise capture of recurring themes (indigenous critique, property vs sharing, schismogenesis, and the misused 'noble savage' trope) useful for future writing or research threads.
