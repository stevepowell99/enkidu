- Core idea: many societies shift between two (or more) social/political systems seasonally — aggregation for rituals/harvest/hunts vs dispersed foraging/farming phases.
- Examples: Lévi-Strauss’s Nambikwara chiefs (switching roles), Inuit (summer/winter social structures), Kwakiutl (winter hierarchical palaces vs summer clan forms), Plains Indians (temporary coercive powers during buffalo-hunt season), Upper Palaeolithic seasonal aggregations linked to monuments.
- Intellectual history: postwar turn toward behavioural ecology (Man the Hunter) framed foragers as a distinct stage; earlier literature (Mauss, Boas) emphasized seasonal dual structures and variability.
- Political theory angle: Clastres — chiefs are deliberate political actors constrained by social institutions that prevent durable coercive power; some societies institutionalize rotation/temporary sovereignty.
- Consequence: challenges linear evolution models (band→tribe→state) because groups routinely move between forms; raises question of how year-round hierarchical statehood became dominant.
- Modern echoes: seasonal reversals persist culturally (e.g., midwinter holiday solidarity, summer vacations) though attenuated.

Key quotes:
- “It was precisely this quality that made the Nambikwara chief such a peculiarly familiar political figure: the calm sophistication with which he shifted between what were in effect two different social systems…”
- “You can’t speak of an evolution from band to tribe to chiefdom to state if your starting points are groups that move fluidly between them as a matter of habit.”

Why: Reframes political authority as often seasonal and contingent, useful for comparative analysis and challenging linear models of social evolution.
