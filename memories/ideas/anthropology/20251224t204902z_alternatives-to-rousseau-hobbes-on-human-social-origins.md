- The common binary (Rousseau's noble, egalitarian hunter-gatherers vs Hobbes's violent state of nature) is false and politically misleading.
- Archaeology and ethnography show pre-agricultural peoples experimented with diverse social forms — "a carnival parade of political forms" rather than a single egalitarian norm.
- The Agricultural Revolution did not inevitably create private property or entrenched inequality; many early farming communities and some early cities were relatively egalitarian.
- Revisiting an "indigenous critique" means taking non‑European social thought seriously instead of casting indigenous peoples as either angels or devils.
- Case studies often cited for either extreme (e.g., Yanomami, Hadza, !Kung) are more complex: Yanomami homicide rates are average-to-low and narratives of universal violence are overstated.
- Empirical tests matter: choices and lived experiences (e.g., Helena Valero living with Yanomami) can undermine simplified claims that civilization is obviously preferable.

Key quotes:
- "the world of hunter-gatherers ... was one of bold social experiments, resembling a carnival parade of political forms."
- "Statements like these are just so many prejudices dressed up as facts, or even as laws of history."

Why: This reframes assumptions about human social origins and supports studying diverse, non‑European perspectives when thinking about politics, inequality and civilization.
