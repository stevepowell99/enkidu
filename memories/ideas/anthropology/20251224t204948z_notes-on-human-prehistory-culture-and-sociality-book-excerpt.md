- Early Homo sapiens in Africa were far more physically and regionally diverse than modern populations; some groups were isolated for tens or hundreds of thousands of years.
- Modern humans are ancestrally African; expansion out of Africa involved encounters and limited interbreeding with Neanderthals and Denisovans.
- Complex symbolic behaviour (art, beads, pigments) appears earlier and more widely than once thought — evidence from Africa, Borneo, Sulawesi, and Eurasia pushes back timelines.
- Contrary to the egalitarian-forager stereotype, Palaeolithic societies show evidence of monumental architecture, princely burials and social complexity without necessarily forming ranked states.
- Egalitarianism appears to be an active social achievement: groups use ridicule, shaming, shunning, and other tactics to check dominance and enforce norms.
- Self-consciousness and extended reflective thought are amplified in dialogue/interaction; historical biases (Victorian/colonial) wrongly assumed ‘primitive’ peoples lacked such capacities.

Key quotes:
- "For most of our evolutionary history, we did indeed live in Africa – but not just the eastern savannahs... The result probably would have struck a modern observer as something more akin to a world inhabited by hobbits, giants and elves."
- "When we are capable of self-awareness, it’s usually for very brief periods... The great exception to this is when we’re talking to someone else."
- "what makes societies distinctively human is our ability to make the conscious decision not to act that way" (on tactics that curb braggarts and bullies).

Why: Captures book observations that challenge simple narratives about human origins, culture emergence, and assumptions about 'primitive' societies — useful for future thinking on diversity and social evolution.
