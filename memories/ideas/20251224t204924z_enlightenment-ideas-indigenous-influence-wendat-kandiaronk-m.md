- European conquerors often acted without authorization, sparking debates about the moral status of indigenous peoples and the justice of conquest.
- Seventeenth-century natural law thinkers foregrounded ‘simple’ societies (Algonkians, Caribs, Amazonians) as exemplars for thinking about a State of Nature and human rights.
- Medieval folk egalitarian rituals and Christian theological equality provided earlier precedents for ideas of universal human equality.
- Missionaries and voyageurs often learned indigenous languages and recognized indigenous reasoning; despite this, European scholars frequently dismissed indigenous intellectual contributions.
- Indigenous societies (e.g., Mi’kmaq, Wendat) were commonly seen as freer, with communal norms of sharing and limited conversion of wealth into power; these features influenced Enlightenment debates about liberty and equality.
- Jesuit observers sometimes characterized indigenous liberty as ‘animalistic’, revealing conflicting European interpretations.
- Kandiaronk (Wendat philosopher-statesman) and dialogues like Lahontan’s circulated critiques of European mores in Enlightenment salons, helping inspire ideas of individual liberty and political equality.

Key quotes:
- Mi’kmaq on comparative wealth: “If we have a morsel of bread we share it with our neighbour.”
- Jesuit Le Jeune on liberty: indigenous people “imagine that they ought by right of birth, to enjoy the liberty of wild ass colts…"
