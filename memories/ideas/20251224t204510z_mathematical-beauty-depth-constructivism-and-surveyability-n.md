- Links visceral experiences (the "overview effect") to formal thought: formal thinking can be passionate and intimate, not merely cold or impersonal.
- G. H. Hardy's criteria for "mathematically significant" ideas: a striking trio — unexpectedness + inevitability + economy; plus two essential qualities he struggled to define: generality and depth (ideas arranged in strata, foundational ideas are deepest).
- The paradox of inevitability vs. unexpectedness is central to mathematical elegance; depth suggests foundational, bottom-up views while overview/unity suggests top-down perspectives.
- Constructivism is ambiguous: Gödel contrasts a "strictly nominalistic" constructivism (Russell-style) with later intuitionistic/constructive schools; "construct" can mean actually buildable, feasibly buildable, or only theoretically constructible.
- "Surveyability" (Edwin Coleman): long modern proofs often fail Cartesian surveyability (memory/ability to hold whole proof at once); raises questions about what counts as a "real" proof.
- Russell's point: terseness/symbolism in logic helps present propositions as wholes to the eye, aiding cognitive surveyability.

Key quotes:

- “...a very high degree of unexpectedness, combined with inevitability and economy.” — G. H. Hardy, A Mathematician’s Apology
- “There are two things at any rate which seem essential, a certain generality and a certain depth; but neither quality is easy to define at all precisely.” — G. H. Hardy
- “...the problem is with memory: ‘our undertaking’ will only be knowledge if all of it is present before the mind’s eye together...” — Edwin Coleman
- “The terseness of the symbolism enables a whole proposition to be represented to the eyesight as one whole...” — Bertrand Russell

Why: Connects aesthetic criteria, foundations/constructivism, and cognitive limits (surveyability) — useful when thinking about mathematical epistemology or designing/formalizing proofs.
