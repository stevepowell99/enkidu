- Two contrasting views of rituals: (a) rituals instantiate and make social structure visible (who sits where, rank, precedence); (b) rituals are liminal moments of collective chaos/creative play that can invert or create new social forms (Boy Bishops, Lords of Misrule, youth abbeys).
- Numerous historical/folkloric examples (Semiramis 'Queen for a Day'; medieval elected/play rulers) show ritual role-playing can temporarily exercise real power and persists even if formal monarchy disappears.
- Early forager groups were highly mobile, not tightly kin-bound (biological kin ~10%); long-distance travel and wide social membership were common; later history tended toward increasing local differentiation rather than globalization.
- Woodburn's argument: genuinely egalitarian societies correlate with "immediate-return" economies (no surplus, sharing rather than storage); "delayed-return" investments (farming, pastoralism) create ties and opportunities for power inequality.
- Measurement critique: ranking societies by property/subsistence (Rousseau/Smith tradition) has limited explanatory power; equality can be about autonomy and everyday freedoms (e.g., Montagnais-Naskapi women's concern to live without male interference).

Key quotes:
- "Some have gone so far as to argue that what we call ‘social structure’ only really exists during rituals." 
- "Humans invariably produce more. We are creatures of excess, and this is what makes us simultaneously the most creative, and most destructive, of all species."

Why: Useful synthesis linking rituals, surplus/economy, mobility and measures of egalitarianism — helps explain how social power emerges and can be contested.
