- Neoliberalism framed as an ideology that treats competition as the defining human trait, privileging market/economic choice over political citizenship and promising meritocratic outcomes.
- Historical roots: Locke's property myth (terra nullius), colonial frontier capitalism (Madeira → São Tomé → Brazil) where land, labour and money were transformed into commodified, exclusive property; boom–bust and frontier-hopping pattern.
- Intellectual/political formation: early neoliberal figures (Mises, Hayek), Mont Pelerin Society, funded think-tank network (Cato, Heritage, AEI, IEA, Adam Smith Institute) that promoted privatization, deregulation and market supremacy.
- Mechanisms and consequences: capital mobility (end of fixed exchange rates), ISDS and offshore systems, structural adjustment (World Bank/IMF) enforcing privatization and austerity — producing rising inequality, erosion of sovereignty, and concentrated wealth (super-rich +$20T since 1989; poorest 50% −$1T).
- Conceptual points: neoliberalism differs from free-market rhetoric — functions as a tool for the very rich to accumulate power (described here as "class war"); rent defined as unearned income from exclusive claims on shared resources.

Key quotes:
- "in the beginning all the world was America." (Locke)
- "business freedom is personal freedom." (Milton Friedman — phrasing noted as a political masterstroke)
- "Neoliberalism is class war." / "We are all neoliberals now."
