- Politics is increasingly dominated by the most anti-social industries because they have the strongest incentive to invest in influencing policy and evade democratic scrutiny.
- Two overlapping capitalist logics: "housebroken" (stable, regulated, long-term investment) vs "warlord" capitalism (rejects taxes/regulation; aggressive, extractive). Oligarchic power is rising alongside corporate power.
- Neoliberal reforms have selective effects: state-shrinking rhetoric paired with large defence increases, privatization-lite initiatives (freeports), and weakened public services (NHS bed cuts; failing dental contract incentives).
- Political manipulation techniques: astroturfing (Tea Party/Americans for Prosperity), reframing economic conflicts as cultural ones, and promoting "conspiracy fictions" that distract from real elite conspiracies.
- Offshore finance and deregulation unbundle state sovereignty; tools like QE mask financial collapse but can't fix fundamental public goods (e.g., food, health).
- Consumerism is presented as the solution to consumerism («consume better»); corporate hypocrisy on environment is highlighted (e.g., Shell exec advice).

Key quotes:
- "I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible." — Peter Thiel
- Reported remark: "Fuck business." — Boris Johnson (on regulatory constraints vs warlord interests)
