- Right/libertarian outlet cluster financed by wealthy backers: UnHerd, GB News, Spiked, Quillette, The Critic, Compact, The Free Press — note Paul Marshall's role and donations (including to Vote Leave) and ties to political figures (e.g., Gove).
- UnHerd NY inaugural event framed political debate around "the gender question" (Lionel Shriver), with little attention to economic inequality or poverty.
- Historical perspective: EP Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class — emphasis on working-class agency ("The working class did not rise like the sun at an appointed time. It was present at its own making.").
- Protest and state response: George Monbiot on harsh sentencing for peaceful protest, case of "Marcus" (16 months leading to deportation risk) and rhetoric about exclusion from power (portcullis / Eadric the Wild references).
- Miners' strike revelations: Armstrong memo indicates MI5 leaked NUM bank-account details and movements to assist seizing union funds; NUM moved £8.7m through multiple countries to obscure accounts.
- Threads to track: how private funding shapes public discourse; focus-shaping at events; state security agencies' interventions in domestic industrial disputes; legal/political consequences for protesters.

Key quotes:
- "the woke mind virus … a genuinely dangerous disease, unlike Covid" — Lionel Shriver at UnHerd.
- "The working class did not rise like the sun at an appointed time. It was present at its own making." — E.P. Thompson.
- Monbiot on sentencing/deportation: prison terms "massively out of line" and 16 months "longer than anyone has served for peaceful protest since all adults had the vote."
