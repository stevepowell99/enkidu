- A miscellaneous set of political/social observations, links and quotes collected together.
- Gordon Brown's list of New Labour achievements (fuel allowance, SureStart, Climate Change Act, etc.) — source link included.
- Migration: dramatic rise in small-boat crossings after 2018; note linking this to the UK leaving the Dublin Regulation (removal of a deterrent/return framework).
- Palantir: company ethos framed as technology in service of the state (Karp's "The Technological Republic"); concern about Silicon Valley embracing a techno-state mission.
- Gaza: striking claim about scale of destruction/displacement/child casualties that should be checked/verified.
- Team GB and Olympics: notes on commercialization/privatisation of national sporting bodies and redistribution of resources to elites.
- Thematic notes: political polarization (V-Dem discussion), spread of online misogyny, UBI reframed as compensation/dividend for commons enclosure, Marx quote on historical constraints, violence-as-public-health framing, and the Overton window concept.

Key quotes:
- "That's the Britain we've been building together, that's the change we choose." — Gordon Brown (list of New Labour achievements).
- "Men make their own history, ... but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances... The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brains of the living." — Marx.
- "...Palantir is eager to embrace this close tie with government work and military work... [technology] being created in service of a state, so a techno state." — summary from Wired on Palantir.
