- Plastic production ($400B/yr) props up the oil industry and is expected to triple by 2050; consumer-level changes (fly less, plant-based diet) matter in narrow areas but wealth is the main driver of environmental impact.
- Wartime US (1942–45) example: massive state spending, bans on car production and appliances, strict rationing, national conservation campaigns and recycling — an illustration of rapid societal mobilization and enforced behavioral change.
- Narrative framing: common heroic “restoration” story reframed to call for building collaborative, inclusive communities as a path to social renewal.
- Democratic alternatives: Murray Bookchin’s social ecology (municipal politics, politics vs statecraft) and its partial real-world application in Rojava; participatory budgeting (Porto Alegre) and deliberative practices in many cities (vTaiwan, Decidim, Lisbon, Seoul, etc.).
- The commons: defined as a community-governed social form distinct from market/state dichotomies (Bollier & Helfrich).
- Political currents: analysis of right-wing populism, elite/populist narratives (Vance, Deneen), proposals to capture administrative state, and evidence of zero-sum attitudes across Europe.

Key quotes:
- FDR (1936): forces of “organised money” and the “organised mob” were “unanimous in their hate for me - and I welcome their hatred.”
- (Reportedly advised to Trump:) “The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.” — invoked as a reminder of historical defiance (Jackson) and risks of ignoring legal checks.
