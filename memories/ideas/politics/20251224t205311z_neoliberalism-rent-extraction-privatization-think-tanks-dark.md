- Core claim: neoliberalism privatized public services, turning collective provision into sources of "rent" (extra fees extracted by owners) rather than principally delivering social utility.
- Language matters: "investment" is often used to mask rent-seeking (buying existing assets to extract rent or capital gains rather than creating productive value).
- Political mechanism: networks of think-tanks (IEA, Adam Smith Institute, Atlas Network) and funders (Kochs, corporate donors) shaped policy, media and academia; they used front organizations and secrecy to appear neutral.
- Historical context: postwar Keynesian redistribution and growth (1945–75) was more equal domestically but relied on extraction from the Global South; neoliberal turn (e.g., Chile/Pinochet) was an experimental template for Thatcher/Reagan policies.
- Political effects: neoliberalism described as a "political neutron bomb" — retaining formal democratic structures while hollowing out economic/political power; dark money fuels policy capture; strongmen and anti-system rhetoric are symptoms.
- Notable consequences: deregulation (Glass-Steagall repeal), privatizations, internal markets in public services, rise of private equity and rentier claims to entrepreneurship.

Key quotes:
- "private opulence and public squalor" — Galbraith.
- "imperative that we should give no indication... that we are working to educate the Public along certain lines as having a political bias" — Smedley on IEA founding strategy.
- "Neoliberalism is a political neutron bomb."

Why: Concise mapping of how privatization, think-tanks and dark money translated into rent extraction and democratic hollowing — useful context for future analysis or projects on political economy.
