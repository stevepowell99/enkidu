- Conference acceptance email (Evaluation 2017 Ignite): instructions for session submitter to accept via AEA site; acceptance deadline Aug 1; tentative Ignite slots listed; registration link and contact emails provided.
- Paasche-Orlow & Wolf (2007): conceptual causal model linking health literacy to three influences on health care — (1) access & utilization, (2) patient–provider relationship, (3) self-care; argues health literacy is both a patient and system phenomenon; empirical data limited and much cross-sectional.
- Braun et al. (2020): overview of online qualitative surveys as a legitimate qualitative method — strengths: "wide-angle lens," diverse samples, suitability for sensitive topics, scalable for unfunded/time-limited work; weaknesses: excludes low-literacy/digitally marginalized groups, lacks probing, requires careful question wording, length and participant info management, and guidance on sample sizes and analysis (treat dataset holistically rather than per-question summaries).
- Yoganarasimhan & Yakovetskaya (2023): comparative study of polarization in content shared via Facebook vs email; introduces a scalable approach using generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) to measure text polarization; finds topic and channel differences and questions simple narratives about platform-driven polarization.
- Practical/logistics: Zotero entries noted; two AEA submission items listed as reminders.

Key quotes:
- "Health literacy should be viewed as both a patient and a system phenomenon." — Paasche-Orlow & Wolf (2007)
- "Qualitative surveys offer one thing that is fairly unique within qualitative data collection methods – a ‘wide-angle lens’ on the topic of interest." — Braun et al. (2020)
