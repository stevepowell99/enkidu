- Foucault notes: key concepts to recall — discourse & power (knowledge ↔ power), panopticism (surveillance/discipline), biopolitics (management of populations), and the social construction of sexuality.
- LLM causality: C. Zhang et al. (2023) show GPT-4 can identify many causal connections in text using domain knowledge but struggles where deeper causal reasoning is required; L. Zhang et al. (2023) propose augmentations for causal reasoning.
- Prompting / rubrics: rubrics (Florencia Guerzovich) are important for genAI in qualitative work; tie prompts to evaluation criteria.
- Sensemaking references to follow up: "Naturalizing sensemaking", "The new dynamics of strategy: Sense-making in a complex and complicated world", and "Making sense of complexity: using SenseMaker".
- QuIP (Qualitative Impact Protocol): notes on blindfolding (degrees and ability to unblind later), small-sample designs (e.g., 12 interviews across locations or 6×4), focus on CHANGES, anchoring recall windows (e.g., 3 years), and distinction between exploratory vs confirmatory approaches for case selection.
- Methods to track: process tracing (see Podestà 2023 synthesis) and VoiPT (Veil of Ignorance Process Tracing) as specific methodological options for causal inference in complex contexts.

Why: Concise capture of theoretical concepts and practical qualitative methods to reuse in future design of social-science or AI-augmented research.
