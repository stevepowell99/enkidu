- Near-death research split into three camps: parapsychologists who see NDEs as evidence consciousness can persist beyond the brain; physicalists who explain NDEs as brain/body-generated hallucinations (e.g., ketamine analogues); and resuscitation/clinical researchers who occupy mixed positions.
- Parapsychologists cite "veridical" NDE reports (patients reporting operating-room details while clinically dead) but these claims lack rigorous, reproducible evidence.
- Newer physiological studies (Borjigin et al.) show intense, synchronized brain activity during and after cardiac arrest in some patients — challenging the assumption the brain immediately and coherently shuts down at clinical death.
- CPR history and exceptional revival cases (e.g., Audrey Schoeman revived after ~6 hours with no evident brain damage) illustrate changing boundaries of "death" and rare long-resuscitation outcomes.
- Climate & environment notes: rough AI energy calc for GPT-4 training (~24–36 GWh estimate); climate attribution framing (X made Y N% more likely); SUV/pedestrian mortality rise; biomass notes (domesticated mammals like cows/humans dominate total mammal mass).
- Food systems: argument flagged that meat industry has an "opportunity" to shift from volume to quality; continued centrality of plant agriculture and potential role for cellular agriculture.
- Music notes: Richard Thompson / Beeswing impressions (Fairport/UK folk vs US influence, Sandy Denny details); link to Jackson C. Frank page.

Key quotes
- "I think in 50 or 100 years time we will have discovered the entity that is consciousness... it wasn’t produced by the brain, and it doesn’t die when you die." — Parnia (parapsychologist/resuscitation specialist).
- "The brain, contrary to everybody’s belief, is actually super active during cardiac arrest." — Borjigin (on synchronized brain waves around death).
- "pedestrian deaths have increased by 59% since 2009... a big one (pun intended) is the size of vehicles on the road." — summary of IIHS-based reporting on SUVs.

Why: Useful capture of clustered ideas on consciousness/NDE debates, surprising brain-activity findings, plus climate/AI energy and music references to revisit for future research or synthesis.
