- Prompts and examples for using AI as a systems-change tool: deep, iterative questioning about Iran's nuclear weapons program (drivers, internal politics, diplomatic influences, non-Western drivers, ideological/legal framings).
- Workflow described: ask multiple AIs for 'balanced' views, then request alternative-perspective analyses (e.g., pacifist/environmental lens), and ask AIs to identify what legal/social/ideological viewpoints their answers align or don't align with.
- Practical technique: ask AI to generate comparative spreadsheets of different viewpoints and supply sources; use iterative follow-ups to surface new nuggets of information.
- Evaluation notes (Julian King): break-even analysis as a pragmatic alternative when CBA lacks data; use rubrics and evaluative judgement to assess Value for Money; example break-even calculation for a recovery program (program breaks even if it helps ~37 people) and cautions about attribution and uncertainty.
- Meta note: repeatedly training a personal ChatGPT on systems thinking improves depth and usefulness of subsequent interactions.

Key quotes:
- "Break-even analysis eases the requirements a little, by turning the question on its head. It asks: What would we have to assume for benefits to equal costs?"
- "We have to determine whether the intervention is *good* use of resources... use rubrics that define good VfM, providing an explicit framework to make a judgement from the evidence."

Why: Captures prompts, methods, and evaluation heuristics for using AI in systems-change research and practical program evaluation.
