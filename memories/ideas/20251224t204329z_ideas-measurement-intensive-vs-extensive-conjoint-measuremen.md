- Distinction: extensive quantities (concatenatable: mass, time, resistance, plane angle) vs intensive quantities (no concatenation, e.g., temperature); psychological attributes treated as intensive but quantifiable via conjoint measurement.
- Conjoint measurement: theoretical route to quantify intensive psychological attributes; references: Foundations of Measurement (Krantz et al.) and Radiant Shiny app for dataset analysis.
- Evaluation notes: principles-focused evaluation (GUIDE: guiding, useful, inspiring, developmental, evaluable), evaluability as checking alignment of aims, outcomes and indicators in inception reporting.
- Linguistics / Guy Deutscher summaries: colour naming, Sapir–Whorf questions, egocentric vs geocentric spatial language (compass-based directions used in some languages), complexity of languages and grammatical features.
- Methods & sampling: triangulation (use of angles/distances; cosine rule generalisation), definition of sampling frame (list of units available for sampling).
- Physics & info: thermodynamic entropy interpreted as proportional to missing microscopic information (Boltzmann constant link to Shannon information).
- Misc idea threads: peer-to-peer development / trust mechanisms (eBay-like reputational validation for aid), items on biodiversity custodianship and IFRC/epidemic fraud example, brief notes on quantum-cloning/CTC implications and swarm science applications.

Key quotes:
- "Temperature is therefore an intensive quantity."
- Quine (summary): "Democritean universe... an infinite latticework of tiny cubical voxels, each one either utterly empty or utterly full..."

Why: Captures concise, cross-disciplinary notes linking measurement theory (esp. intensive attributes), evaluation practice, and related conceptual references worth recalling for future research or projects.
