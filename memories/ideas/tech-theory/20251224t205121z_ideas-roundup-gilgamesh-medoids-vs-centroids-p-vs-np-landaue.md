- Epic & myth: Gilgamesh (demigod) and Enkidu defeat Humbaba and the Bull of Heaven; Enkidu's death drives Gilgamesh to seek Utnapishtim and immortality — influence on later epics noted.
- Clustering: medoid vs centroid — medoid must be an actual data point; centroid is the mean position and may not correspond to any real point.
- Complexity & computation: P vs NP framed as "are problems verifiable in polynomial time solvable in polynomial time?"; Kolmogorov complexity measures shortest program/description length of an object.
- Physics & information: Landauer's principle — a minimum energy cost to erase one bit (Landauer limit), linking information to thermodynamics; note distinction enthalpy (total energy) vs entropy (disorder).
- Cosmology & forms: argument that the hot Big Bang isn't the absolute beginning; inflation explains early energy state without a singular arbitrarily hot point.
- Math methods: closed-form solution = analytic expression using finite standard operations; otherwise use numerical methods (iterative approximations).
- Biology & classification: Woese -> horizontal gene transfer and three challenges to categorical thinking (species, individual, tree); archaea distinct from bacteria and eukaryotes.
- Culture & myths: notes on high fantasy themes (good vs evil), Hyperborea myth, and Childe Roland summary.

Key quotes:
- "a medoid must be an actual data point, whereas a centroid is the calculated average position of all data points."
- "The Big Bang is not the beginning of the Universe!"
