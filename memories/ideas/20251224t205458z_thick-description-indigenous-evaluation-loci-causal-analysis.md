- Geertz's "thick description": distinguish description of facts vs explanation of context, meaning, motivations (e.g., Balinese cockfight).
- Nan Wehipeihana's evaluation loci: five prepositions showing where power sits — evaluation done "to", "for", "with", "by", "as" indigenous peoples (continuum from Western to Indigenous control); useful framework for reflecting on power-sharing in evaluation.
- Causal analysis in philanthropy (Lynn et al., 2021 "Lost Causal"): philanthropy often uses descriptive evaluation; recommends focusing on contribution/plausible causal claims rather than impossible attribution; participatory causal methods can reveal mechanisms (example: Brazilian winemakers).
- Participatory/outcome-harvesting approaches: center lived experience and insider researchers (e.g., Jeph Mathias' work with street youth) to access hidden mechanisms and context.
- Mixed methods & measurement ideology: measurement choices reflect belief systems; "mixed method" often masks deeper epistemological positions (Bob Williams quote summarized).
- genAI in qualitative work: resources and experiments — BECauSE corpus for annotating causal language; interest in using NLP to detect causal claims; topic-model alternatives using clustered pretrained embeddings; ChatGPT used for quick contextual summaries/examples.

Key quotes:
- "Evaluation done _to_, _for_, _with_, _by_, _as_ indigenous peoples" — concise ladder of locus-of-power in evaluation practice.
- (Paraphrase) "Thick description" = describe meaning/context/motivations, not just facts.
