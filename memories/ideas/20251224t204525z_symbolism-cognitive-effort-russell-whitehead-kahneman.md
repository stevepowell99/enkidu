- Symbolization extends thinking by making abstract relations manipulable; symbolic collocations map to idea-collocations and allow mechanical trains of reasoning.
- Russell: symbolism is useful because it can make reasoning deliberately non‑obvious so rules can be applied mechanically to reveal what follows from what.
- Whitehead: civilization progresses by automating important operations of thought so they can be performed without conscious effort; symbolism enables near‑mechanical transitions.
- Kahneman / dual-process: System 1 (fast, intuitive) vs System 2 (slow, effortful); naming/labels and working-memory load matter for how easily we can think.
- Practical note in file: appended conference/contacts / Theorymaker / AEA / EES planning notes — useful metadata/contacts for evaluation events.

Key quotes:
- “Symbolism is useful because it makes things difficult.” — Bertrand Russell
- “Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.” — Alfred North Whitehead
- “Unless you are fairly self conscious about symbols ... you will find yourself attributing to the thing properties which only belong to the symbol.” — Bertrand Russell

Why: Understanding how symbol systems reduce cognitive effort helps design clearer reasoning practices, tools, and evaluation work.
