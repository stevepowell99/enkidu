- Helena Valero: left Yanomami for ‘Western civilization’ but chose to return — an example of Europeans preferring indigenous life.
- Indigenous societies praised for freedoms (including sexual freedom), mutual care against destitution, and different values than market-driven toil.
- Non-market long-distance exchange: heirloom arm-shells/necklaces (Massim) circulate as social/adventure practices rather than commodified trade; regional interaction spheres include dreams/vision quests and women's gambling.
- Call for a new history: ask how inequality became an issue rather than assuming it always existed; question the Great Man narrative in intellectual history.
- Contextualizes Rousseau’s Discourse as part of an essay contest and situates Enlightenment ideas as influenced by encounters with indigenous peoples and other societies (China, India).
- European bureaucratic/linguistic uniformity models borrowed from China; indigenous critiques had real impact on European thought and challenged standard meta-narratives that downplay indigenous agency.

Key quotes:
- "When an Indian Child has been brought up among us... if he goes to see his relations and make one Indian Ramble with them there is no persuading him ever to return." — Benjamin Franklin (letter)
- "Is this ‘trade’? Perhaps, but it would bend to breaking point our ordinary understandings of what that word means." — on Massim heirloom exchanges

Why: Captures arguments and examples that reframe the origins of inequality, non-market exchange, and the influence of indigenous critique on Enlightenment thought — useful for future writing or research on alternative social histories.
