- US bombing of Cambodia (1965–1973): >2 million tons of bombs — comparable to the ~2 million tons the Allies dropped during all of WWII (including Hiroshima/Nagasaki).
- Collection of links/highlights on climate/policy debates: COP28 coverage, debate over degrowth vs growth (Krugman quoted), and doughnut economics adoption by local authorities.
- AI and evaluation notes: thematic coding/text summarisation challenges (algorithmic fairness, alignment); tutorial on using ChatGPT for foresight (futures wheel / mindmap prompts).
- Evaluation methods / CBA: cost–benefit analysis framed as part of evaluation — strength (single summary number) and limitation (can miss values).
- Randomised controlled trials / JPAL: claim that RCT-derived programmes have improved hundreds of millions (~600m) of lives; historical notes on origins of randomisation (van Helmont, Fisher) and an ancient example from Book of Daniel.
- Various short factual fragments to follow up: Portugal's Carnation Revolution anniversary, Bihar caste census result (noted as ~two-thirds in one line), and a Kindle note "On the road".

Key quotes:
- "the US dropped more than 2 million tons of bombs on Cambodia from 1965-1973. For context, the Allies dropped just over 2 million tons of bombs during the whole of World War II."
- Krugman on degrowth: "There is no necessary relationship between economic growth and the burden we place on the environment... delinking growth from environmental impact isn’t just possible in principle but something that happens a lot in practice."
- RCT/JPAL claim (paraphrase in notes): programmes from RCTs have improved the lives of over ~600m people worldwide.
