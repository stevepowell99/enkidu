- Cultural notes (films/plays/books/poems): includes W.B. Yeats "When You Are Old" excerpt, Konstantin Wecker "Liebes Leben" lyrics link, origin story of "The Sound of Silence" (Paul Simon practicing in bathroom), Dickens details (walking habit, Pickwick Papers, Madame Defarge knitting as memory device), Michael Sheen/Port Talbot acting background.
- Prehistory & archaeology: Neanderthal care/shelter evidence; cave constructions (stalactite/stalagmite circle); Solecki Kurdistan finds; Stonehenge "altar stone" traced to Inverness/Orkney — implication for late Neolithic mobility; pliosaur skull discovery in Dorset.
- Broad timelines (quick reference): universe ~14B; Earth ~4.5B; life ~4B; photosynthesis ~3.5B; eukaryotes ~2B; multicellular ~1.5B; dinosaurs ~250M; flowering plants/mammals ~200M. Hominin timeline: first hominins ~5M; genus Homo ~3M; controlled fire ~1.5M; Neanderthals ~0.5M; Homo sapiens ~250K; earliest rock art ~75K.
- Modern/history leads: Yugoslavia football note (Red Star 1991); Guardian piece on UK/US role in heroin trade post-Soviet-Afghan war; Tudjman alleged Holocaust denial; Ashraf Marwan noted as dual-hero intelligence figure.
- Misc/local tech: Stephen's Cleveland motor car and drum-brake invention (locally sourced, highly preserved).
- Follow-ups / research actions: check linked sources (Dickens wiki, Wecker, Guardian piece, Gilgamesh) and flag items to expand into separate notes (Stonehenge isotope/source studies; detailed Jackson C. Frank bio and discography; Neanderthal burial/ care evidence).

Key quotes:
- "I can't play. You're looking at me." — Jackson C. Frank (during recording session)
- "The Sound of Silence was the first song I wrote which seemed to come from some place that I didn’t inhabit." — Paul Simon
