- Couzin studied locusts in a lab "locust accelerator" and observed density-dependent shifts from disordered milling to aligned marching; key mechanism was cannibalism (bugs biting those behind), not explicit cooperation.
- Experimental proof: cutting a nerve that senses bites from behind abolishes swarming — showing a simple sensory mechanism can drive group alignment.
- Theoretical context: Vicsek's 1995 model (individuals align with neighbors within a radius) predicts phase transitions from disorder to order as group size/density increases.
- Historical models of emergence: Conway's Game of Life and Reynolds' Boids (three rules: cohesion, separation, alignment) show how very simple local rules produce complex collective patterns.
- Modern drivers: improved imaging, computer vision, and computation are enabling direct observation and quantitative linking of models to animal collectives; same simple rules appear across scales (cells, animals, humans, robots).

Key quotes:
- “You can cut the nerve in their abdomen that lets them feel bites from behind, and you completely remove their capacity to swarm.”
- “Behavior that seems impossibly complex can have disarmingly simple foundations.”

Why: Demonstrates that simple local interactions (even antagonistic ones) can generate large-scale, predictable group behavior — a transferable explanatory framework for biology, robotics, and social systems.
