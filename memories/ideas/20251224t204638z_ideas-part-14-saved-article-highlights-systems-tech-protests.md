- Collection of saved article links and highlights spanning protest policing, tech criticism, systems thinking, and data tooling.
- Notable items: Guardian reports on arrests/bruising and absence of police discipline; Kara Swisher interview on tech founders as performative/rapacious; reflection on Jane Jacobs' The Nature of Economies as an entry to systems thinking; Dave Snowden on uncertainty matrices (Cynefin); practical dplyr vignette on tidy evaluation.
- Practical takeaway: dplyr uses tidy evaluation — data masking (arrange, filter, mutate, group_by, summarise) vs tidy selection (select, rename, across, pull); indirection patterns needed when programming with these verbs.
- Civic/political note: documented chilling effects — electronic monitoring and fear of attending demonstrations after convictions; no officers disciplined in several high-profile cases.
- Follow-ups: (1) Re-read Jacobs + synthesize with Cynefin for systems-thinking notes; (2) apply dplyr programming vignette when writing reusable functions; (3) track legal/disciplinary updates on protest policing cases.

Key quotes:
- "I thought it was all performative... all soft and squishy, but hard as nails on the inside. And that’s what these people were, right? They were always killers. Every one of them." — Kara Swisher (on tech founders)
- "Economies are complex adaptive systems, not static machines..." — Jane Jacobs (The Nature of Economies)
- "The key idea behind data masking is that it blurs the line between the two different meanings of the word 'variable'... env-variables vs data-variables." — dplyr vignette
- "no officers have faced disciplinary action for their conduct" — reporting on protest policing outcomes
