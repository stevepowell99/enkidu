- Armstrong memo: MI5 materially aided the government during the miners’ strike; calls for reassessing the secret state's role in Thatcher’s victory and its long-term effects on UK politics.
- Putin note: emphasis on his need for absolute victory and symbolic dates; historical analogy to Ceaușescu (1989) as a cautionary example.
- Cooperatives (Mondragón / Eroski): overview of model — one-member/one-vote, wage solidarity (≈6:1), large member buy-in (~€17k), €10.6bn revenue, benefits (worker ownership, community reinvestment) and constraints (capital access, agility, exposure to market pressures).
- Collective choice theory: Arrow’s impossibility theorem — tradeoff between inclusivity (demos) and coherent governance (kratos); relevance to online moderation and democratic decision-making.
- Quantitative methods notes: p-value as p(D|H0) (probability of data or more extreme under H0); heuristics emphasis — Take-the-Best, fast & frugal heuristics, tallying; Gigerenzer's ecological rationality critique of Kahneman/Tversky.
- Qualitative / tooling notes: Chopra & Haaland approach; interview-linking and "history agent" ideas; OpenAI Assistants vs Llama-3 cost tradeoffs; causal mapping reference (Klintwall et al.) for perceived causal networks in depression.

Key quotes:
- “rich societies, not rich people”.
- fragment on Dickens: "issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together".

Why: Concise capture of disparate political, economic and methods ideas worth revisiting for analysis, writing, or research planning.
