- Poverty: large reduction since 2000 but concentrated — between 2002 and 2011 five countries accounted for >85% of the drop; note: "problem of means".
- Philosophy: via negativa (easier to agree what something is not); surveyability in Kant vs Wittgenstein (seeing matters whole); Kant's antinomies, esp. Third Antinomy (freedom vs deterministic causality).
- Derrida & meaning: différance and deconstruction compared to Bayesian uncertainty; useful analogy for LLMs (texts as layered context producing many proximate meanings); example: constitutional interpretation vs originalism.
- Etymology: "saunter" possibly from à la sainte Terre (to the holy land).
- Nature — crows/corvids: tool use (nut-dropping), folklore (Odin's ravens, Aesop), and a short British corvid species list with key behaviors.
- Lifestyle/memory: drawing improves retention vs rewriting/visualization (Waterloo study); sleep fragmentation note: "Every night we wake up three to six times, but you need to be awake for five minutes to remember being awake." — Wilson.
- Near-death studies: field split into schools (spiritualist/evangelical vs skeptical/scientific), Moody and psychomanteum noted.

Key quotes:
- "Every night we wake up three to six times, but you need to be awake for five minutes to remember being awake." — Wilson
- "There is a difference between Kantian exhibition and Wittgensteinian surveyability... the attempt to see matters whole, i.e., to take in the object of one’s thought in a single glance." (excerpt)
