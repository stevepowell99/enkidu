{"ts":"2025-12-24T12:57:47Z","role":"assistant","content":"Enkidu is a wild-man created by the gods to balance Gilgamesh. He is civilized by Shamhat and then becomes Gilgamesh’s close friend and ally. Together they defeat Humbaba and kill the Bull of Heaven, angering the gods. Enkidu falls ill and dies, and Gilgamesh grieves deeply, which prompts his later quest for immortality. The epic ends with Gilgamesh returning to Uruk wiser about mortality, the value of companionship, and leaving a lasting legacy."}

It exists in 12 tablets and was originally written in Akkadian (with roots in earlier Sumerian myths). Modern translations are widely available (e.g., Andrew George, Stephen Mitchell, Norman Sandars). Would you like a recommended translation or a link to read it online?"}
