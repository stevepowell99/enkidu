## Dream triage — 2025-12-24

What I did
- Cleared and triaged recent inbox drafts (moved each to an appropriate canonical location or to cleanup). Specifically:
  - Moved Bosnian-study items into memories/learning/bosnian so quiz requests and the chosen study topic (participles) are available for reuse.
  - Created a canonical learning-preferences note under memories/learning capturing the user's stable preference for short language quizzes (Bosnian & English) and their habit of choosing study topics.
  - Consolidated Letta inbox drafts: created a canonical Letta overview under memories/interests/letta and archived older duplicates to memories/cleanup/archived-20251224.
  - Canonicalised Gilgamesh material: created a single gilgamesh note under memories/interests/gilgamesh merging the inbox items; originals archived.
  - Moved one ambiguous note (connection between Letta and Gilgamesh) to memories/cleanup/needs_review and added a short explanation; left it tagged needs_review because the intent is unclear.

Why
- Followed organisation preference to consolidate inbox drafts into canonical notes under memories/howto, memories/projects, or memories/interests and to archive redundant/older inbox drafts. This reduces inbox clutter while preserving provenance (source_refs point to archived originals).
- Stored stable user preferences (language-quiz habit and study-topic selection) under memories/learning for reuse when generating quizzes or study plans.
- Placed ambiguous/interpretive material into cleanup/needs_review so the user can confirm intent later.

Result
- Inbox entries processed and moved into canonical or archival locations; a small set of new canonical notes were created to improve discoverability and reuse.
