Merged duplicate Letta project notes and fixed a learning-preferences source reference. Actions: (1) Consolidated two Letta overview drafts into a single canonical project note at memories/projects/20251224t135956z_letta-overview.md — merged tags and kept provenance via source_refs. (2) Deleted the redundant duplicate file memories/projects/20251224t164638z_letta-overview.md. (3) Updated memories/learning/20251224t164638z_learning-preferences.md to point to the actual English-preference note (memories/learning/english/...) so provenance is correct. Reason: remove near-duplicate project notes to reduce clutter, preserve provenance by keeping source_refs to archived inbox captures, and correct a broken/incorrect source reference so learning preferences reliably point to the English-preference note.
