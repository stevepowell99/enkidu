### Dream diary — 2025-12-24T16:45:06Z

Summary of actions:

- Cleared the inbox by moving language-learning and interest captures into structured folders:
  - Moved Bosnian study and quiz requests to memories/learning/bosnian/.
  - Moved an English-quiz preference to memories/learning/english/.
- Consolidated Letta captures into a canonical project summary at memories/projects/20251224t135956z_letta-overview.md and archived the original inbox captures under memories/cleanup/archived-20251224/ for provenance.
- Merged Gilgamesh-related inbox captures into the canonical interests note memories/interests/20251224t105009z_interest-in-archaic-myths.md and archived the originals.
- Saved the associative note linking Letta and Gilgamesh to memories/interests/20251224t112058z_connection-between-letta-and-gilgamesh.md.
- Updated instructions/work.md with one small preference note: the user often requests short language quizzes (Bosnian/English) and chooses study topics — these should be stored under memories/learning.

Rationale: reduce inbox clutter, create clear canonical locations for recurring themes (learning, projects, interests), and archive originals to memories/cleanup for provenance and possible rollback.
