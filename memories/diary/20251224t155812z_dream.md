### Summary\n- Canonicalized 'Interest in Archaic Myths' note by moving 20251224T105009Z_Interest-in-Archaic-Myths.md to 20251224t105009z_interest-in-archaic-myths.md and deleting the near-duplicate 20251224T111719Z_interest-in-archaic-myths.md.\n- Created a cleanup log note at memories/cleanup/duplicate_cleanup.md documenting the change and rationale.\n- Rationale: improves consistency, reduces confusion due to case-sensitive filenames, and strengthens retrieval with consistent slugging.\n\n### Why this helps\n- Fewer duplicates; easier search; improved memory hygiene.
