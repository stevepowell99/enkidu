## Dream triage — 2025-12-24T18:04:38Z

What I did
- Moved two inbox notes into memories/learning/bosnian/:
  - 20251224t175742z_request-5-question-bosnian-mcq-participles-harder.md (request for a harder participles quiz)
  - 20251224t175723z_bosnian-quiz-difficulty-choice.md (difficulty choice for the Bosnian quiz)

Why
- Both captures are language-learning items (quiz request and difficulty choice). Placing them under memories/learning/bosnian keeps quiz requests and related metadata together for reuse and provenance.

Notes
- Inbox cleared of these items. No merge was necessary because each file records a distinct capture (request vs difficulty choice). If the user repeatedly specifies difficulty preferences, we can consolidate that into memories/learning/learning-preferences for stable reuse.

## Applied ops

```json
[

    "to": "memories/learning/bosnian/20251224t175742z_request-5-question-bosnian-mcq-participles-harder.md",
    "resolved_from": "memories/inbox/20251224t175742z_request-5-question-bosnian-mcq-participles-harder.md"
  },
  {
    "op": "move",
    "from": "memories/inbox/20251224t175723z_bosnian-quiz-difficulty-choice.md",
