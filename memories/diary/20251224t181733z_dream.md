## Dream triage — 2025-12-24T18:17:33Z

What I did

- Created folder memories/recipes and consolidated two inbox recipe captures into a single canonical note: memories/recipes/20251224t181733z_personal-recipes-cookable-list.md.
- Added source_refs to preserve provenance to the original verbatim sources.
- Deleted the two original inbox drafts to clear the inbox.

Why

- Reduce inbox clutter and avoid duplicate notes while preserving source provenance.
- Provide a single, easy-to-find reference for frequently used recipes for meal planning and shopping.
