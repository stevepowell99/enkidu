## Dream triage — 2025-12-24T18:17:33Z

Actions performed

- Created memories/recipes and merged two inbox recipe captures into one canonical note (memories/recipes/20251224t181733z_personal-recipes-cookable-list.md) with source_refs to preserve provenance.
- Deleted the two original inbox files to clear the inbox.

Rationale

Consolidation reduces duplication, improves discoverability for cooking/meal-planning needs, and follows the organisation preference to canonicalise inbox drafts while keeping verbatim sources intact for verification.
