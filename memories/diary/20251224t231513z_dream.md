Inbox empty — no action taken.

What I checked
- Confirmed there are no items in memories/inbox/ to triage.
- Looked for obvious duplicates (duplicate_report is null) and near-duplicates in the catalog; none required safe merging or deletion.
- Verified global preference-tag hygiene per instructions/work.md: found the UK/US spelling note (memories/howto/20251224T1009220000_UK-US.md) tagged with "style" (appropriate as a global preference). Domain-specific learning preferences are tagged with domain tags (e.g., learning-preference), which follows the guidance.
- Reviewed selected_files (notably instructions/work.md and several howto/readme notes) for any stable preference signals that would justify updating instructions — nothing new required.

Why no changes
- Inbox is already empty and there are no clear duplicate-cleanup operations or mis-tagged global preferences that need immediate fixing.
- Avoiding needless reorganisation preserves provenance and minimizes risk of accidental edits.

Suggested follow-ups
- Periodic scan (weekly) for new notes incorrectly using global preference tags; if uncertain, move suspect notes to memories/cleanup/needs_review with a short note and tag needs_review.

Summary: no filesystem operations performed.
