What I did

- Consolidated recent inbox-archive drafts by moving seven files from memories/cleanup/archived_inbox_20251224/ into the central archive folder memories/cleanup/archived-20251224/. Reason: these were small, related drafts about causal mapping/AI workflows that duplicated material already canonicalised under memories/howto and memories/projects. Centralising them in a single archive folder reduces clutter and makes later consolidation/merging easier.

- Cleaned and canonicalised the learning-preferences note (memories/learning/20251224t164638z_learning-preferences.md). I fixed malformed tags and added a short front matter + concise, factual body describing stable user learning preferences (short MCQs, Bosnian-focused tailoring, chosen study topics). Reason: this is a globally useful preference (affects future quiz and lesson generation) and needed a clean, reliable canonical record.

Why

- The moves reduce duplicate/fragmented drafts across two archive locations so future maintenance and canonicalisation (into howto/projects) is simpler.
- The cleaned learning-preferences note makes it easier to reuse stable preferences in future interactions and follows the instruction to keep the "preferences slice" tidy and explicitly global.

Next steps I recommend (no-op now)

- Review the consolidated archived-20251224 files and merge their unique content into the canonical howto notes (e.g. ai-assisted-causal-mapping-workflow, causal mapping overview) where appropriate, adding source_refs to memories/sources/verbatim/* for provenance.
- Do not delete any memories/sources/verbatim files (they are preserved for provenance).
