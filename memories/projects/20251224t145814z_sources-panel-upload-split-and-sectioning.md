- Upload sources (PDF, DOCX, RTF) and manage custom metadata via columns.\n- Split large documents into multiple sources using hard separators (regex patterns); this creates multiple sources with IDs like \"Source Number 12\".\n- Upload flow automatically navigates to the right UI: selects sources, switches to Create Links, and loads the first source in the editor.\n- Section Separators (soft) let you carve imported texts into sections via regex; sections can be filtered using the Everything Filter.\n- Section headers are detected and assigned section IDs (e.g., Section Number 12).\n- Custom Columns support metadata management and enable cross-panel analyses (e.g., Sample Check, pivot/filters).\nSource: content/999 Causal Map App/100 Sources Panel ((sources-panel)).md

Why: Keeps a reference to how the Sources Panel handles uploads, separators, and sectioning for later workflow reminders.
