- Key idea: futures are constituted by narratives and values, and changing values requires changing the narrative.
- Values link to personal identity and affect; narratives give them legitimacy.
- Education and policy for social change rely on envisioning futures and acting today to shape conditions.
- Change is described as three modes: More of the same, increasing qualitative change, and major ruptures—predicting them is difficult.
- Meaning is co-constructed through dialogue (Vygotsky, Bakhtin); we negotiate understanding in social interaction.
- Moral development theories (Kohlberg; Gilligan) highlight competing priorities between justice and care in dilemmas.
