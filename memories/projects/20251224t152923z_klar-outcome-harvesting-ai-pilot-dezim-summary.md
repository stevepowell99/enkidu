- Purpose: Pilot an AI interviewer “Harvest Assistant” for Outcome Harvesting in the KLAR! programme, focusing on scalability, inclusion, and democratic evaluation value.
- Key method move: AI-led interviewing plus AI post-hoc transcript analysis to draft a structured OH outcome table; strong traceability via verbatim short citations and page references; explicit missing-information prompts; human validation to de-duplicate outcomes across sources (triangulation).
- Results highlights: 39 invited; 19 responded; 38 outcome statements; 6 met SMART criteria; others retained as leads; real-time outcome summaries enable respondent validation and transparency.
- Operational insights: prompt simplicity improves adherence; model choice matters; version prompts/models for comparability; scaling shifts bottlenecks to analysis unless end-to-end workflow is designed.
- Risks / responsible scaling: GDPR/legal basis, consent, third-party naming pathways; document data flow and model/prompt versions; data sovereignty (EU-hosted inference where possible); attention to equity/digital divides.
