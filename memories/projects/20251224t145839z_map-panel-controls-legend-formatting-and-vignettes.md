- Interactive map panel presents causal relationships as a draggable network: drag nodes, click links to edit, and drop one factor onto another to create new links.
- Map controls include Jump to factor (type-to-search), Refresh layout, Copy image to clipboard, Copy legend, Zoom in/out, and double-click to zoom.
- Map legend is a discrete text legend showing project names and included sources, citation coverage, visual encoding explanations, and applied filters; you can copy the legend text.
- Map formatting offers layout choices (Interactive, Print/Graphviz), with options for factor labels, link sizes and colors, link labels, and a self-loops toggle.
- Grid layout explains grid-coordinate tags in labels and how layout direction (LR/TB/BT) affects placement; grid layout can be toggled on/off.
- Vignettes provide AI-generated narrative summaries: Whole Map versus Typical Source, output in Markdown with headers, lists, quotes, and metadata.
