- Causal mapping helps make sense of causal claims in interviews, conversations, and documents by coding qualitative data into maps that present individuals' and groups' mental models.
- It can be used to test an existing theory of change or to develop collective empirical theories about how a program works, based on stakeholders’ experiences.
- Narratives and reflections are coded and displayed as maps to show mental models and to support exploration of actual causal connections.
- It distinguishes between evidence for a causal link and the link itself; the evaluator determines whether causality exists.
- Causal maps help answer what happened and what caused it by linking factors, outcomes, and inputs, and by outlining intermediate steps and connections.
- It is most useful in complex settings for learning and program improvement; it requires expertise in coding and qualitative analysis.

Key quotes
- "A global causal map resulting from a research project can contain a large number of links and causal factors."
