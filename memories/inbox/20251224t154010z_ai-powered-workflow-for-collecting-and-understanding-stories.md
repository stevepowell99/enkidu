- Proposes an AI-assisted causal mapping pipeline to collect and analyze stakeholder perspectives at scale, using an AI interviewer and automated coding to identify causal claims and synthesize results into causal maps.
- Allows collecting evidence for a program theory and its causal influences simultaneously without requiring a prior theory, enabling faster qualitative analysis.
- Demonstrated via interviews about problems facing the USA; results suggest efficient data collection and useful maps, with potential for evaluation, alongside limitations and ethical concerns and the need for human oversight and verification.
- Outlines steps: Step 1 — Using an AI interviewer to gather causal information at scale; Step 2 — Using automated causal mapping to code causal information; emphasizes post-hoc coding, adjustable prompts, and that a program theory can be approximated during evaluation.
- Introduces concepts like causal landscapes and distinguishes evidence from causal links; notes that AI-assisted methods can scale, but still require human judgment for evaluation.
