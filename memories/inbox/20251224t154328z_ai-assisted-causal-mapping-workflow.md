- Proposes collecting structure/theory and contribution evidence in parallel, not solely from a fixed ToC.
- Core idea: causal mapping as causal QDA (influence → consequence) with provenance; AI as low-level assistant, human evaluator handles high-level design.
- End-to-end pipeline: Step 1 AI interviewer; Step 2 autocoding causal claims; Step 2c clustering; Step 3 maps/queries.
- Demonstration study via MTurk across three timepoints; analogue, not generalizable to USA claims.
- Reported results: AI interviewing acceptability, autocoding effort, recall/precision, and coverage of overview maps.
- Takeaway: good for sketching causal landscapes and triaging hypotheses, but not enough for high-stakes single-link adjudication; outputs depend on clustering choices and human decisions; ethics risks with third-party LLM APIs.

Why: Shows a scalable framework for causal mapping using AI to handle data collection and initial coding, with human-led interpretation and clear caveats.
