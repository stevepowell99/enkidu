- QuIP is a qualitative protocol for data collection and analysis of complex health interventions.
- It uses narrative data from focus groups and interviews with service users and stakeholders, focusing on predefined outcome domains.
- Causal maps summarize and compare reported causes with the intervention’s theories of change, revealing multiple pathways and emerging factors.
- It emphasizes case-by-case evidence, not magnitude estimates, and can complement quantitative methods.
- Interviews are typically goal-free and open-ended to reduce bias and avoid reliance on a control group.
- Data are analyzed to produce empirical causal maps and examine mechanisms across stakeholder groups.
- Purposive sampling helps capture variation and context; QuIP fits well with case-study evaluations in health settings.
