- Purpose: Show how QuIP-style causal mapping can compare an official programme ToC (their theory) with empirically coded beneficiary narratives (our theory) to revise ToCs and middle-level theory.
- Minimal definition: A causal map is nodes + directed links; a link means someone believes C influenced E; links need not encode necessity/sufficiency, nor quantified strength/polarity.
- QuIP as causal mapping: Goal-free elicitation reduces confirmation bias; causal back-chaining elicits causes, causes-of-causes, etc.; coding is inductive and multi-source; maps are filtered/queried to answer evaluation questions.
- How analysis is actually done: Global maps are too large; use filters (theme/keyword searches, distance steps, frequency thresholds); hierarchical coding / zooming out: encode subfactors in factor labels so detailed factors can be rolled up into higher-level factors for readable summary maps; evidence strength is shown with counts on links (mentions / sources).
- Interpretation pitfalls: Beliefs about causation are not facts about causation; absence of a mentioned link is not evidence of absence; transitivity trap / context overlap; aggregation/generalisation is non-trivial; counts support confidence but don’t convert to “truth percentages”.
