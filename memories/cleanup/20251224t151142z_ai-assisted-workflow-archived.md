- Purpose: evaluate AI-assisted identification and labeling of causal claims in text and compare to human coding; assess the strength of evidence for each claim rather than modeling the system itself.
- Approach: naive, pragmatic causal coding using an AI assistant to extract undifferentiated causal links and supporting quotes; avoid judging magnitude or polarity.
- Dataset: subset of 3 sources, 163 text chunks (~15 pages of A4).
- Tooling: implemented via a web app (Causal Map) with GPT-4.0; transferred through human-readable instructions; sequential processing of transcripts.
- Findings: results are encouraging for scalable qualitative coding; highlights benefits and notes risks and ethical considerations.
- Relevance: demonstrates a simple, generic workflow for large-scale qualitative analysis of narrative data.

Key quotes:
- There is no denying that the model can infer codes and relevant themes, and provide descriptions which are meaningful and even identify patterns which researchers did not consider relevant and ultimately contribute to better qualitative analysis. (De Paoli, 2023)

Why: Documents a scalable AI-assisted workflow for extracting and summarising causal claims from story-based transcripts, useful for rapid qualitative analysis.
