Original short note suggested a parallel between Letta's focus on long-term memory in AI agents and the themes of memory and legacy in the Gilgamesh myth. Intent is ambiguous (metaphor vs topical overlap). I have preserved this draft in cleanup/needs_review for the user to review. Recommendation: keep as 'needs_review' until the user confirms whether they intended a conceptual link or a separate interest.
