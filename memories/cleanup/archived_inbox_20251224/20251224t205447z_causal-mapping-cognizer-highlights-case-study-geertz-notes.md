- Cognizer: comprehensive package for eliciting and analysing cause maps; uses "constructs" and visual representations; supports aggregation by Sum/Mean/SD across pairwise construct weightings.
- Measures & comparison: distance metric (0–1) advocated to capture intersubjective belief (dis)similarity; Langfield‑Smith & Wirth proposed content-based distance but didn’t deliver software.
- Tools & suitability: Decision Explorer, CMAP2 and others exist; many dedicated tools are more appropriate for idiographic/small‑N work and less suited to large‑scale nomothetic hypothesis testing.
- Analysis approaches: cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, additive/extended similarity trees, multinomial analysis/logistic regressions to link map patterns with exogenous variables.
- Data cautions: transforming diverse inputs to standard constructs is subjective and cumbersome; CMAP2 can help distil maps from interviews, recordings, documents.
- Methodological notes: elicitation tends to be relatively unstructured; researchers disagree on ontological status of maps. Also: notes on case-study revival (useful for capturing interactions that produce outcomes) and Geertz’s "thick description" vs Lévi‑Strauss structuralism.

Key quotes:
- "elicit the strategic structure of an event — that is, to capture the interactions that produce an important outcome." (on the value of case studies)
- "Aggregated maps do not necessarily reflect the views [of individuals]" (caveat about aggregation)

Why: Captures practical tools, analytical methods, and key cautions for future causal-mapping or case-study work.
