- Causation: no method has direct access to counterfactuals — methods estimate counterfactuals; distinguish many true explanations (ontological plurality) from listing ways we learn about causation (epistemology).
- Qualitative coding: In Vivo Coding = use participant's exact words; Free/Open/Descriptive Coding = researcher-generated labels summarizing/interpreting data.
- Sea-lioning (social media anecdote): BlueSky interaction led to being labeled a "sea lion" despite trying to inquire; lessons about perceived bad faith, thread structures, and how consolidation of replies can be interpreted as evasive.
- Evaluation notes: Outcome Harvesting often collects outcomes from implementers (so independent checking is important); Scriven on evaluation as a potential transdiscipline and his "logic of valuing" (introduce context, allow vagueness, admit direct observation of causation/value, probative reasoning); note on attribution and word-use meaning.
- Methods & schools: references to PAR/Paulo Freire, Clifford Geertz (interpretive anthropology, symbols/meanings), Lévi-Strauss (hot vs cold societies), and storytelling/Tolstoy observation.
- Practical: social-media conversation structures affect perceived intent; distinguishing genuine inquiry from trolling is hard when issues are emotionally charged.

Key quotes:
- "The sealioner feigns ignorance and politeness while making relentless demands for answers and evidence ... so that when the target is eventually provoked into an angry response, the sealioner can act as the aggrieved party." (Wikipedia summary of sealioning)
- "letting the client down at exactly the moment they need you most" — Scriven (on rejecting summation in evaluation)

Why: Concise capture of methods, a social-media lesson, and evaluation/theory references useful for future research or writing.
