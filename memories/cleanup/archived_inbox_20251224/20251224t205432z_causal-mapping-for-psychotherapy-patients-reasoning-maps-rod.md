- Idea: use causal mapping (individual cause–effect networks) to elicit patients' causal models of their problems; maps can reveal central nodes (rumination, worry) and feedback loops that standard symptom lists miss.
- Method noted: highly structured elicitation (respondents choose links from an exhaustive list of connections among predefined items) — long tradition (Bougon 1977); useful clinically and for targeting high-centrality nodes in therapy.
- Proposed variant: elicit narrative-based causal maps (ask for different stories of how an episode developed, allow emerging items) — likely more linear, fewer feedback loops, but may capture sequence and idiographic variation.
- Rodrigues et al. (2017): Reasoning Maps extend ideographic causal/ICM maps toward multicriteria evaluation; propose a multilinear evaluation model using MACBETH because Reasoning Maps alone cannot explicitly model value interactions or do quantitative ranking.
- Practical tools: Cognizer (Clarkson & Hodgkinson 2005) — software for elicitation and analysis of cause maps.

Key quotes:
- "a symptom is not an indicator of an underlying latent disorder but an item in a causal network which has got stuck in the sense of having unhelpful positive feedback loops." 
- "Causal maps with an ideographic nature... have been extensively employed in Operational Research for supporting problem structuring and complex decision-making processes." (Rodrigues et al., 2017)

Why: This suggests a practical method to capture patients' causal beliefs and target therapeutic interventions, and links methods (Reasoning Maps, Cognizer) that could be adapted for research or clinical use.
