- Contrast: Ex‑ante = prediction/selection (should we do this?); Ex‑post = accountability/learning (did it work?).
- Practical tools: ex‑ante uses CBA, risk assessment, feasibility; ex‑post uses PIR, variance analysis, ROI and observed data.
- Causal mapping / "causal reasoning lite": aim to marshal common‑sense intuitions and mixed‑quality data to produce plausible, decision‑useful causal claims without over‑mathematizing.
- Evaluation practice: emphasise the evaluator as facilitator of dialogue between contradictory contributions (bridging voices rather than acting solely as activist or neutral technocrat).
- Methods notes: QCA tip (adding cumulative indicators), attention to node semantics in causal graphs, and caution against overinterpreting low‑quality mixed data.
- Measurement aside: reminder of formal measurement idea (magnitude = r × [unit]) and that some scales (e.g., temperature) measure differences rather than absolute magnitudes.

Key quotes:
- "Ex‑ante is about prediction and selection; Ex‑post is about accountability and learning."
- "When we do this work we capture narratives... then initiate mapping at the level of competence to act... Learning needs to be peer to peer as much as it is mediated." — Dave Snowden

Why: Captures practical distinctions and approaches for lightweight causal reasoning and evaluation useful when advising funders or designing reviews.
