- Pilot of an AI interviewer, Harvest Assistant, for Outcome Harvesting in the KLAR! program, aiming for scalability, inclusion, and democratic evaluation value.
- Method: AI-led interviewing plus AI post-hoc transcript analysis to draft a structured OH outcome table; emphasizes traceability with verbatim short citations and page references; explicit prompts for missing information; human validation to de-duplicate overlapping outcomes across sources (triangulation).
- Results highlights: 39 invited; 19 responded; 38 outcome statements; 6 met SMART criteria; others retained as leads; real-time summaries enable respondent validation and transparency.
- Operational insights: prompt simplicity improves adherence; model choice and version prompts matter; scaling shifts bottlenecks to analysis unless end-to-end workflow is designed.
- Risks / responsible scaling: GDPR/legal basis, consent, third-party naming pathways; document data flow and model/prompt versions; data sovereignty (EU-hosted inference where possible); attention to equity/digital divides.

Why: Provides a concise reference of purpose, methods, results, and risks for the KLAR OH AI pilot to inform future reuse and methodological decisions.
