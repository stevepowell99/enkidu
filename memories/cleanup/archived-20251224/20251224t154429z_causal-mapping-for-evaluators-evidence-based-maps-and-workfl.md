- Causal mapping is about diagramming 'what causes what' with provenance; used since the 1970s across disciplines and is under-utilized in evaluation.
- In evaluation, treat causal maps as repositories of causal evidence: assemble narrative evidence into a link database with provenance, then use that evidence to judge what is really happening.
- Core workflow (3 tasks): Task 1 Gather narrative causal material (interviews, documents, archives); Task 2 Code causal claims as links (concepts: influence factor → consequence factor) with provenance; Task 3 Use the link database to answer evaluation questions and produce selective, readable maps.
- Key distinctions: primary object is evidence-with-provenance; epistemic-first (burden on organising claims) and lightweight causal typing; contexts and boundaries must be tracked.
- Limits/risks: inference depends on source credibility; difficulty capturing magnitude or necessity; transitivity can mislead across non-overlapping contexts; boundaries are often messy.
- Concrete analytic contributions: treat diagrams as an index into underlying transcripts; quantify robustness via path analysis (e.g., maximum flow/min-cut) and source-thread counts to show supported links.
- Evaluator payoff: supports assembling evidence about interventions, searching quotations, enhancing transparency, and communicating complexity; separate evidence gathering from judgement of what is really happening.

Why: clarifies treating causal maps as evidence repositories to support transparent, structured evaluation.
