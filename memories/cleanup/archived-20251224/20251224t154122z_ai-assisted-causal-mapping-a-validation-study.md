- AI-assisted causal mapping was evaluated as a low-level assistant to identify causal claims in a corpus of stories from development aid recipients, compared with human experts.
- The authors adopt a naive, pragmatic approach to causation: identify undifferentiated causal links without measuring strength or polarity, using a predefined template to reduce analyst degrees of freedom.
- The method is partially automated and designed to be almost completely automated apart from high-level directions to the AI.
- Automated thematic and causal coding are discussed, with LLMs showing potential to match human coding performance for qualitative tasks.
- The test used a subset of the QuIP dataset (3 sources, 163 text chunks, ~15 pages) and a web app (Causal Map) with GPT-4.0.
- It focuses on constructing models of evidence for causal relationships rather than modeling the system itself, and notes limitations in polarity/strength.
- Risks, ethics, and areas for further research are discussed.

**Key quotes**

- "There is no denying that the model can infer codes and relevant themes, and provide descriptions which are meaningful and even identify patterns which researchers did not consider relevant and ultimately contribute to better qualitative analysis."
- "The simple, lowest-common-denominator approach to causal link extraction, which we propose, is easy enough that the details of the process can be almost completely automated (apart from critical high-level directions to the AI about what exactly we want to find out)."

Why: Demonstrates a scalable AI-assisted workflow for extracting causal claims from text, useful for rapid qualitative analysis in causal mapping.
