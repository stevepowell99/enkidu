- Core question: what minimum features must be added to a sparse causal-mapping vocabulary to capture the "storiness" of individual narratives while preserving ability to aggregate across many stories?
- Hypothesis: aggregated causal maps lose some "storiness"; primary useful output may be the single most typical (or most representative) story retold using global labels while indicating shared pathways and preserving original detail.
- Methods/tools noted: consider valence/aspirational links/chain features, SNA for network perspective, and simple metrics like NPS (net promoter score) for user feedback.
- Disinformation / polarisation examples to remember: US military/propaganda around Sinovac (Philippines); CIA staged vaccination backlash in Pakistan and violence against vaccinators; Sweden "troll farm" reporting and political media attacks — relevant to how narratives spread and how aggregated story-signals form.  
- Stats/probability reminders: Pareto vs power law distinction; base-rate error; Bayesian note — posterior predictive distributions produce distributions rather than point estimates (useful for uncertainty-aware predictions); small-N Bayes examples (Dion/Copestake) showing how few consistent cases can raise confidence rapidly.
- AI/NLP points: agent-based architecture vs agentic behavior distinction; attention/Gestalt as a lens for perception of wholes; provenance as a practical test for AI-generated images; alignment/superalignment flagged as an ongoing concern.

Key quotes:
- "if it trends, it’s true" — Renée DiResta (useful aphorism about social-media truth dynamics).
- "instead of a fixed point as a prediction, a distribution over possible points is returned." — summary of Bayesian predictive thinking.
