- Causal mapping is a method for diagramming 'what causes what' with explicit provenance and has existed since the 1970s but is underused in evaluation.
- Treat causal mapping as a discrete evaluation task: assemble causal evidence from narratives into a link database, then use that evidence to judge what is really happening, without forcing a single prior ToC.
- Distinguish causal mapping from adjacent approaches: primary object is evidence-with-provenance; epistemic-first, ontic-later; lightweight causal typing.
- Key dimensions of variation: mode of construction (documents, interviews, groups), elicitation openness (open vs closed), and context handling (single-source vs multi-source) and coding philosophy.
- Three-stage workflow: Task 1 gather narrative causal material; Task 2 code causal claims as links (with endpoints); Task 3 answer evaluation questions using the link database and produce selective maps.
- Limits/risks: inference depends on source credibility; difficulty capturing effect strength; transitivity across overlapping contexts.
- Concrete analytic contributions: index diagrams to the underlying transcript/source corpus; evaluate robustness with path-based metrics (e.g., maximum flow/min cut) and source-thread counts.
- Conclusion: assemble evidence first, then judge what is really happening; this separation improves transparency and supports readable, evaluable graphics.
