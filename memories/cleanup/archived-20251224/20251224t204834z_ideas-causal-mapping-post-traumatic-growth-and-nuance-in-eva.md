- Map the "geography/geology" of human experience around post‑traumatic growth: two approaches suggested — reduce the cloud of individual differences to 2–3 measurable linear dimensions, or extract constructs from testimonies (look for recurring causal factors and links).
- Notes on nuance and high‑stakes decisions: debates between quantitative and qualitative approaches converge on "what works, for whom, in what circumstances"; reductionism (league tables, single metrics) is dangerous when used for top‑down policy decisions.
- Evaluator point: evaluators often cannot set their own questions — this shapes methods and outputs differently than academic qualitative research.
- Causal QDA / causal mapping + AI: proposed as a practical alternative to open‑ended thematic analysis — identify every causal claim/edge, which improves intersubjective verifiability, is easier to automate, yields causal structures useful for evaluation, and reduces arbitrary coder discretion (still not bias‑free).
- Practical implications: narrow prompts when using AI or, better, ask for causal mapping; ensemble agreement and transparent workflows increase reproducibility; causal mapping better supports answering causal/evaluation questions than static themes.
- Miscellaneous seeds: political balance as binary opposites (Levi‑Strauss/game theory), bricolage & Polanyi, and a note about perceptions of unprecedented danger vs living in the present.

Key quotes:
- "There *is* such an instruction: it's called causal mapping."
- "We often see evaluators and other researchers using AI for tasks like 'list the main themes in this document'... The trouble with that is it's massively sensitive to what one means by a theme."

Why: Useful short record of a methodological preference (causal mapping + AI) and idea seeds for studying post‑traumatic growth and how to communicate nuanced findings to policy.
