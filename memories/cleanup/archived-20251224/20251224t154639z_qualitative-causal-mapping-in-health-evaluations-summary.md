- Purpose: Position QuIP + causal mapping as a credible, cost-effective way to elicit and analyse perceived drivers/barriers in complex interventions (including health services evaluations).
- Data collection stance: QuIP focuses on changes that matter to respondents, and the perceived causes of those changes; goal-free / blindfolded questioning reduces pro-project bias; unprompted mentions are important evidence; not designed to estimate effect sizes; complements quantitative inference and other theory-based approaches.
- Coding stance: Coding is pairs/chains of cause→effect factors (causal nuggets); only causal claims coded; non-causal descriptive text is not; inductive label harmonisation across sources; analyst should manage positionality and avoid over-fitting to prior ToC.
- Use: Compare empirical causal maps against ToCs; compare groups (e.g. men/women; staff cadres) and pathways; keep a traceable link from visual summaries back to underlying quotes for verification/peer review.
- Relationship to realist ideas: Affinity to mechanism/context thinking (multiple pathways), but with broader open capture rather than only a few hotspots.
- Source: 000 Articles/Qualitative causal mapping in evaluations (health) -- Summary (book chapter).md

Why: Clarifies the coding and use guidelines for qualitative causal mapping to anchor memory on method and workflow.
