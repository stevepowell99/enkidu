- Fully qualitative online surveys align with qualitative research values and offer rich data, but the method is underutilised and lacks broad methodological discussion.
- Online delivery expands reach and provides a “wide-angle lens” to capture diverse perspectives and sense-making.
- They can reach sensitive topics, but literacy and the digital divide may exclude some participants; careful design can mitigate.
- Avoid summarising responses per question; treat data as one cohesive dataset and develop analytic patterns across the full dataset.
- Sample sizes vary widely (roughly 20–49 to 60–99 or more) depending on context; ensure justification in design.
- Key design considerations include question wording, overall length, completion instructions, and clear participant information.

### Key quotes
- “qualitative survey data capture what is important to participants, and access their language and terminology.”
- “a wide-angle lens on the topic of interest that provides the potential to capture a diversity of perspectives, experiences, or sense-making.”
- “Online qualitative surveys are ideally suited to sensitive research.”
