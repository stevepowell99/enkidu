- Causal mapping helps make sense of causal claims from qualitative data by coding and displaying as maps of mental models.
- It can be used to test an existing theory of change or create collective empirical theories of change about how a program works based on stakeholders' experiences.
- Narratives and reflections provide qualitative data that can be coded and displayed as maps to present cognitive structures of individuals and groups and to support further exploration of actual causal connections.
- These maps help answer questions about what people think happened and what they think caused this by linking different factors, showing intermediate steps and connections between them.
- Causal mapping distinguishes between evidence for a causal link and the causal link itself; the evaluator makes the inferential judgement about causality.
- This method requires expertise in coding and analysis of qualitative data; it is less suited for precise mathematical modelling or analyses of quantitative data.
- It is useful for learning and program improvement and can be used during a program lifespan as part of adaptive management and final evaluation.
- Key quotes:
  - "A global causal map resulting from a research project can contain a large number of links and causal factors. By applying filters and other algorithms, a causal map can be queried in different ways to answer different questions, for example to simplify it, to trace specific causal paths, to identify significantly different sub-maps for different groups of sources, etc. With certain assumptions, it is possible to ask and answer questions like 'which is the largest influence' or 'which is the most positive effect'."

Why: Helps structure qualitative causal claims into testable mappings for evaluation.
