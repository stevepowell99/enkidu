- Proposes evaluating structure/theory and contribution simultaneously via an AI-assisted causal mapping pipeline (causal QDA) with provenance.
- AI acts as a low-level assistant for interviewing and exhaustive extraction; high-level design and interpretation remain human-led.
- End-to-end steps: Step 1 - AI interviewer; Step 2 - autocoding causal claims; Step 2c - clustering labels; Step 3 - analysis via maps/queries.
- Demonstration study: MTurk respondents; three timepoints; analogue demonstration, not generalizable about the USA.
- Key metrics: interview acceptability; autocoding time/cost; recall/precision; overview maps cover ~42% of claims.
- Interpretations: useful for sketching causal landscapes; not for high-stakes adjudication without human checks.
- Caveats: ethics; bias; non-random participation; strength of evidence not magnitudes; API data risks.
