- Causal mapping is a long-standing “what causes what” method with directed links; it has been used since the 1970s across disciplines and is under-used in evaluation; this paper synthesises broader literature and reframes it for evaluators.
- Niche: treat causal mapping as a discrete evaluation task: (i) assemble causal evidence from narrative sources into a provenance-backed link database; (ii) use that evidence to judge what is really happening, without forcing early convergence on a single ToC.
- Key distinctions from adjacent approaches: primary object is evidence-with-provenance; epistemic first, ontic later; lightweight causal typing with cautious use of weights when elicited.
- Variants across causal-mapping approaches: mode of construction (coding documents, interviews, group maps, hybrids); elicitation openness (closed vs open, with forward/back chaining); handling of single vs multi-source contexts; coding philosophy (variables vs changes, standardisation/merging).
- 3-task workflow for evaluation: Task 1 Gather narrative causal material; Task 2 Code causal claims (link-based QDA); Task 3 Use the link database to answer evaluation questions with selective maps, robustness checks, and context-aware summaries.
- Limits/risks and analytic contributions: credibility of sources matters; effect magnitudes are hard to capture; transitivity can mislead across contexts; contributions include treating diagrams as an index to transcripts and metadata and applying max-flow/min-cut and source-thread counts to gauge robustness; evaluator payoff: separate data gathering from interpretation and improve transparency.

Why: Provides a compact, evidence-focused protocol for using causal maps in evaluation, separating data gathering from interpretation.
