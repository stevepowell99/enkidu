- Purpose: Position QuIP + causal mapping as a credible, cost-effective method to elicit and analyze perceived drivers and barriers in complex interventions, including health services evaluations.
- Data collection stance: Focus on changes that matter to respondents; goal-free / blindfolded questioning to reduce pro-project bias; unprompted mentions treated as important evidence; not designed to estimate effect sizes; complements quantitative inference and other theory-based approaches.
- Coding stance: Coding is inherently causal: pairs/chains of cause-effect factors; only causal claims are coded; non-causal descriptive text is not; inductive label harmonisation across sources; manage positionality to avoid over-fitting prior ToCs.
- Use: Compare empirical causal maps against ToCs; compare groups (e.g., men/women; staff cadres) and pathways; keep a traceable link from visual summaries back to underlying quotes for verification/peer review.
- Relationship to realist ideas: Affinity to mechanism/context thinking (multiple pathways), but with broader open capture rather than only a few hotspots.

Why: Captures the core methodological stance of QuIP causal mapping for health-evaluation work, enabling quick recall and reference.
