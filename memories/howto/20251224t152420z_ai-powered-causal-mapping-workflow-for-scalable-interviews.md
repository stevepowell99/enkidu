- AI-assisted causal mapping pipeline gathers and analyses stakeholder perspectives at scale.
- Simultaneous collection of evidence for program theory and causal influences, without requiring a prior theory.
- An AI interviewer conducts interviews; automated coding identifies causal claims; causal mapping visualizes results.
- Tested by interviewing participants about problems facing the USA; demonstrates efficient large-scale qualitative data collection and visualization.
- Discusses potential for rapid evaluation, with limitations and need for human oversight and verification.
- Emphasizes that causal mapping distinguishes evidence for a causal link from the causal link itself; AI tools augment rather than replace human judgment.
- Steps: Step 1) AI interviewer; Step 2) automated causal mapping.
