- QuIP stands for Qualitative Impact Protocol, a qualitative approach for data collection and analysis of complex health interventions.
- It collects narrative accounts from focus groups and interviews, focusing on predefined outcome domains and using causal mapping to identify how and why changes occurred.
- It helps test theories of change, surface new or unexpected causal factors, and provide an independent reality check to complement quantitative methods.
- Data are analyzed via causal qualitative data analysis and empirical causal maps, enabling comparisons with theories of change and across stakeholder groups.
- It relies on open-ended, goal-free interviewing to reduce bias, often without a control group, and emphasizes case-by-case evidence and latent counterfactuals.
- QuIP aligns with Realist Evaluation and related approaches, but emphasizes broad outcome domains, multiple pathways, and context sensitivity rather than universal laws.

Key quotes:
- I have been happier and more confident since I joined a local community gardening group. Sometimes I didn’t see people for weeks at a time but now I talk to people at least once a week.
- I don’t think that my fitness has changed much in the last year, I tried doing an outdoor fitness group, but I didn’t like it when it was wet, and I haven’t found anything else that I can afford to do.

Why: Reminds me of QuIP's causal-mapping approach to evaluating health interventions and how it complements quantitative evidence.
