- Do qualitative causal analysis on the selected links by applying filters or transforming them.
- The Filter System applies filters in order, top-to-bottom, with a default Factor Label Filter; you can Add Filter, Enable/Disable, Remove, Collapse, or Clear All.
- Filters are saved to the URL only if non-default and enabled; disabled filters are ignored and shown dimmed.
- The pipeline includes filters like Zoom Filter, Collapse Filter, Remove Brackets Filter, Factor Label Filter, Exclude Factor Label Filter, and Path Tracing Filter to shape labels, group terms, and trace paths.
- Performance features: smart caching for filter results and embeddings to speed up repeated parameter changes.
- Some filters temporarily relabel factors (Transform filters) without altering originals; permanent renaming can be done via search/replace tools.
