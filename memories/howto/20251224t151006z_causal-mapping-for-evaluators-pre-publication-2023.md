- Causal mapping collects, codes and visualises interconnected causal claims to show what people believe causes what, and to prepare these claims for evaluative judgments.
- It should be seen as a repository of evidence for causal pathways, not just a model of beliefs, addressing the Janus-like dual life of such data.
- The article provides a short history and definitions of causal mapping, drawing on Axelrod, Eden, Laukkanen, and related work; it also notes software such as Decision Explorer.
- Practical workflow: gathering data, coding causal claims, constructing maps, and using them to answer evaluative questions; discusses strengths, weaknesses and future potential.
- It situates causal mapping within evaluation practice and related literatures (sensemaking in organisations, QuIP qualitative impact protocol).
- The work aims to broaden systematic use of causal mapping in evaluation and to provide guidelines arising from action research and software tools.
