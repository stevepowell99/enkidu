- Purpose of QuIP-style causal mapping: compare an official programme ToC (their theory) with empirically coded beneficiary narratives (our theory) to revise ToCs and middle-level theory.
- Minimal definition: a causal map is nodes + directed links; a link means someone believes C influenced E; links need not encode necessity/sufficiency or quantified strength.
- QuIP as causal mapping: goal-free elicitation reduces confirmation bias; causal back-chaining elicits causes/cause-of-causes; coding is inductive and multi-source; maps are filtered/queried to answer evaluation questions.
- How analysis is actually done: global maps are too large; use filters (themes/keywords, distance steps, frequency thresholds); hierarchical coding / zooming out to roll up subfactors into higher-level factors; evidence strength shown with counts on links.
- Interpretation pitfalls: beliefs about causation are not facts; absence of a mentioned link is not evidence of absence; transitivity/context overlap; aggregation/generalisation is non-trivial; counts support confidence but don’t convert to truth percentages.
