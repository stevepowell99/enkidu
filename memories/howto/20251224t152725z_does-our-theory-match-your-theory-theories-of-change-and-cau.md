- Case study of an entrepreneurship programme for rural women in Ghana, examining whether beneficiaries' views of causal drivers align with the organization's Theory of Change; mid-term evaluation using QuIP and the Causal Map tool.
- Defines causal maps as networks of causal factors where a link between C and E represents perceived causal influence, with theories of change understood as causal maps.
- Describes QuIP methodology: collecting stories of change from intended beneficiaries with partial 'blindfolding' to avoid bias, coding causal factors, and visualizing results in Causal Map; concept of goal-free evaluation.
- Highlights how causal maps support strategic thinking by revealing how evidence-based adjustments can modify the wider or middle-level theory and program design.
- Differentiates how maps complement raw qualitative data by enabling querying for questions like which factor has the widest influence and which paths lead to outcomes.
- Notes a figure example (Figure 1) illustrating a simple causal map with COVID-19 and downstream factors; link numbers show frequency.

Key quotes:
- A causal map can be defined as consisting of links or arcs between nodes, such that a link between C and E means, in some sense, that someone believes that C has or had some causal influence on E.
- Causal mapping is an umbrella term which includes the construction of theories of change, which can themselves be seen as causal maps.
- It provides ways to deal with unstructured and unexpected evidence, and if required, to combine it with more structured evidence.

Why: Provides a compact reference to how causal maps and ToCs can be used to interpret beneficiary perceptions against program design.
