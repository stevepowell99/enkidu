- Provides a repeatable protocol to convert any content into a formatted Twitter thread
- Enforces per-tweet length (<240 characters) and explicit start/end markers
- Uses THREAD START on its own line and THREAD END on its own line
- Requires clear, engaging language and faithful content transfer
- Specifies how tweets are separated (blank line, i.e., two newlines)
- Keeps a Source reference for traceability
