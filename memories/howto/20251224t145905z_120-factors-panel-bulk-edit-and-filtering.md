- The Factors panel lists all unique labels from the current filter pipeline and shows metrics such as Citation Count, Source Count, and In/Out counts; it sorts by citation count (desc) and supports click-to-select with server-side pagination.
- Actions include Delete, Relabel, Search/Replace, and Merge for selected factors; controls disable until at least one factor is selected.
- Bulk Edit mode lets you edit multiple factor labels at once with multi-cursor editing, find occurrences, and line-by-line editing; changes require Save Changes and show a confirmation of affected links.
- Search/Replace lets you filter to matches, preview replacements, and apply updates only to the currently selected links (not across all sources).
- A toggle Use filters can switch filtering to either the links' filters (on by default) or filter only by project and sources.
