- Causal mapping helps make sense of the causal claims people make in interviews, conversations, and documents by coding, combining, and displaying data as maps that reflect mental models.
- Maps show individuals' and groups' mental models and support exploration of causal connections, useful for testing a theory of change or building collective empirical theories based on stakeholders’ experiences.
- It distinguishes between evidence for a causal link and the causal link itself; it does not itself determine causality and relies on the evaluator to judge whether a link is causal.
- It helps understand causal pathways in complex settings by visualizing connections between context, activities, and outcomes, and supports sharing and collaborative use of findings.
- It is not intended for precise mathematical modelling; it requires expertise in coding and qualitative data analysis.
- Useful for guiding the use of this method and ensuring findings are accurately described, mindful of sampling and data collection biases.
