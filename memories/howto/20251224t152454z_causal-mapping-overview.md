- Causal mapping converts qualitative data from interviews and documents into maps that reveal mental models and causal connections among factors.
- It helps test theories of change or build collective empirical theories based on stakeholders’ experiences.
- Maps show what people think happened and what they think caused it, linking inputs, activities, and outcomes into causal pathways.
- The method distinguishes evidence for a causal link from the link itself; final causal judgments are made by the evaluator.
- It requires careful coding and clear sourcing; not ideal if evidence isn’t clearly identified with a source.
- It supports learning, program adaptation, and collaborative use of findings; useful across a program's lifespan.
- Useful resources include the Causal Map App and CMAP3 guides.

Key quotes:
- "By applying filters and other algorithms, a causal map can be queried in different ways to answer different questions."
