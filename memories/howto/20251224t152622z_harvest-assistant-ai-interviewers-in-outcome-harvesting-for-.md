- Harvest Assistant: AI interviewers used within Outcome Harvesting (OH) to scale qualitative, participatory evaluation of democracy.
- Pilot details: KLAR! climate adaptation program in Austria; 19 of 39 invited stakeholders responded; 38 Outcome Statements produced; 6 met SMART criteria; real-time summaries increased transparency and participant ownership.
- OH basics: outcomes are observable changes in behaviour, relationships, policies, or practice; core narratives are the outcome, significance, and contribution descriptions; SMART criteria guide specificity, measurability, and timeliness.
- Benefits and guardrails: AI can broaden access and reduce costs, but risks include disinformation, bias, and exclusion; a hybrid model with human oversight is recommended for validation, ethics, and sensemaking.
- Process implications: OH uses iterative, snowball sampling; meaningful stakeholder involvement is time-consuming and requires skilled harvesters; AI can help but does not replace human facilitation.
- Context: chapter draft on AI-assisted democracy evaluation within KLAR!, with two Austrian municipalities (Bad Ischl and Ebensee) and the Qualia/Gemini setup; source path provided below.

Why: Illustrates a practical, scalable approach to democratic evaluation that balances AI-enabled efficiency with human judgment.
