- OH+AC updates Outcome Harvesting by adding Attitude Change to consider inner transformation alongside observable behavior change.
- It preserves OH’s core principles while expanding data units to include Related Attitude Change and Steps 3–5 (Engage with Human Sources to Refine BC Statements; Substantiate BC Statements; Analyze and Interpret the Harvested Outcomes).
- Attitude changes are treated as outcomes when essential to program results or central to stakeholders’ worldviews; otherwise, ACs are documented separately as attitude-related data.
- OH+AC borrows from social psychology—mental models, internal non-observable elements, and attitudes as a broad, multi-faceted construct—to understand how inner life shapes change.
- Practical workflow includes identifying BCs, adding ACs, verifying with human sources, and interpreting the harvest; lone ACs may require separate documentation.
- When pairing OH+AC with quantitative AC surveys, sequence OH+AC first to maintain an inductive approach.

## Key quotes
- "An Attitude Change is not considered an outcome because it is not observable." (p. 6)
- "Mental models may be the most strategic place to intervene within a system in order to change it." (p. 13)
- "Attitude is clearly a broad concept, which can be broken down in different ways." (p. 19)
