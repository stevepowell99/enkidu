- To code a causal link, highlight a passage within a single statement; the selection is shown in the Quote window and must be an exact quote from one part of the text.
- In the Link Editor, start typing the cause factor at the start of the link in the first dropdown; select an existing factor or create a new one; finish with a comma or tab to add more.
- Repeat the same process in the end box to specify end factors; you can create multiple links by combining different causes and effects; the system creates all combinations when you Save.
- When finished, press Enter to complete the link and use the right-arrow in the source navigator to move to the next source.
- The Link Editor includes fields for Cause/Effect selectors, Quote, Chain toggle, Plain coding toggle, Tags, and Favorite buttons; you can add multiple causes and effects.
- By default, a link has one cause and one effect; multiple causes/effects produce cross-product links on save. Source: content/999 Causal Map App/070 Create Links tab ((create-link-tab)).md
