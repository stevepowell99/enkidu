- Topic: AI-powered workflow for collecting and understanding stories at scale via causal mapping
- Core idea: AI interviewer + automated coding + causal mapping to synthesize results, without requiring a prior theory
- Steps:
  1) Use an AI interviewer to gather causal information at scale
  2) Use automated coding to identify causal relationships
  3) Use causal mapping to visualise and synthesise results
- Benefits: enables rapid, large-scale qualitative analysis and useful causal maps for evaluation
- Limitations: requires human oversight and ethical considerations; potential biases in AI coding
- Source: 000 Articles/!!eval2025.md

Why: Offers a scalable, AI-assisted method for collecting and evaluating stakeholder perspectives in program evaluation.
