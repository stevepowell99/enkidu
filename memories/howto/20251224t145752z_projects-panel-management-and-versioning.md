- Create, load, edit, archive, and manage visibility (read-only) for projects.
- Bulk actions: delete, tag management, archive toggle, and merge projects.
- Set sharing/permissions: email invites, read-only access, global/public read-only, permission badges; admin panel for user management.
- Edit Project modal may show a notice about public visibility to editors/owners/admins; viewers won't see it.
- Versioning: auto backups every 10 minutes when edits occur; manual backups; restore from a UTC-listed version via a dropdown with confirmation; ability to revert to latest; backups stored in a private project-versions bucket with access controls.
