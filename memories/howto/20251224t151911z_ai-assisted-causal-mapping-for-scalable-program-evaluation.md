- AI-assisted causal mapping pipeline collects evidence for program theory and causal influences simultaneously using an AI interviewer, automated coding, and causal mapping.
- Demonstrated with interviews about USA problems; shows efficient large-scale qualitative data collection and useful causal maps; highlights need for human oversight and ethical considerations.
- Core idea: convert text into causal networks by coding X -> Y links with source provenance; separates evidence from the causal claim.
- Step 1: AI interviewer gathers causal information at scale; Step 2: automated mapping codes causal links, enabling scalable analysis; notes on prompt engineering and supervision.
- Benefits: reduces dependence on pre-existing theory, accommodates diverse sources, useful for program monitoring and evaluation.
- Relation to theory: builds on Contribution Analysis and Mayne's program theory; generalises evidence gathering for program theory and causal influences.

Why: It documents a scalable, AI-assisted approach to gather and synthesize causal evidence for program theory, enabling large-scale qualitative analysis without relying on a fixed pre-existing theory.
