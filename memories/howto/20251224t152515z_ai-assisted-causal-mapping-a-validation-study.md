- AI-assisted causal mapping demonstrates using an AI assistant to exhaustively and transparently identify and summarize causal claims in text sources.
- The study emphasizes assessing the strength of evidence for causal links rather than modelling the system, enabling transparent, scalable coding.
- A naive, pragmatic coding approach is used, focusing on identifying undifferentiated causal links with a predefined template to reduce analyst degrees of freedom.
- The method is validated on a QuIP-style dataset, using a subset of 163 text chunks from interviews, and implemented via a web app with GPT-4.0.
- The paper discusses risks, ethical issues, and areas for further research, and cites prior work on causal mapping and AI-assisted coding.
- Key quote: "There is no denying that the model can infer codes and relevant themes, and provide descriptions which are meaningful and even identify patterns which researchers did not consider relevant and ultimately contribute to better qualitative analysis."

Why: Demonstrates scalable AI-assisted qualitative coding for causal claims, enabling faster, evidence-focused analysis in large text corpora.
