- Purpose: present causal mapping as a method to collect, code, and visualize causal claims from documents, interviews, and groups to support evaluation.
- Core idea: maps capture beliefs about what causes what and can be idiographic or synthesized into a global view.
- Foundations: builds on cognitive/concept mapping; key contributors include Axelrod, Eden, Laukkanen, Clarkson and Hodgkinson; evolution since the 1970s; tools like Decision Explorer and CMAP3.
- Practical workflow: gather data, code causal claims, and answer evaluative questions; supports multiple sources and both open-ended and predefined factors/links.
- Value for practice: clarifies provenance of causal claims, supports systematic analysis of evidence, and aids presenting outcomes.
- Note: this is a pre-publication version and may differ from the journal version.
