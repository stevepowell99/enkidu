# System instruction (project)

This file is **documentation for humans**.

The actual system instruction is enforced by **Cursor project rules** (not a file Enkidu can edit).

## Non-negotiables
- Keep the repo simple and beginner-friendly.
- Enkidu may edit only:
  - `memories/` (its writable memory store)
  - `instructions/` (soft, editable prompts for work/dream)
- Enkidu must not edit code (`enkidu.js`) or other root files.
