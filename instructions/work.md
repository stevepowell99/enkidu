summary: Preference-slice & tagging hygiene guidance
---

Purpose
- Keep the global "preference" / "style" / "habits" slice narrowly scoped: only tag notes with these global tags when the preference clearly applies across most interactions (e.g., "use UK English spelling").

Rules
- Use global preference tags (style, preference, habits, preferences) only for truly cross-cutting cues (tone, default language, global response style).
- For domain-specific preferences (language-learning habits, recipe format, research-methods choices), use domain tags such as learning-preferences, recipes, work-habits, or research-preferences instead.
- When in doubt, prefer a domain tag. A small cleanup job can retag items later if something truly belongs in the global slice.

Why
- Prevents a few domain-specific notes from dominating retrieval across unrelated tasks.
- Keeps personalized assistant behaviour predictable and locally controllable.

Actionable follow-ups
- Periodically scan new notes created in "ideas/" and "projects/" for mis-tagged global preference tags and retag accordingly.
